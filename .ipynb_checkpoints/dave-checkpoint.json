            "text": "Note 1 Organization and Nature o f Business Overview: Dave Inc. (“Dave” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, with headquarters located in Los Angeles, California, is a financial services company. Dave offers a suite of innovative financial products aimed at helping Members improve their financial health. To help Members avoid punitive overdraft fees and access short-term liquidity, Dave offers its flagship 0% interest ExtraCash product. Through the Dave Checking Account and the Dave Goals account, the Company provides Members with an affordable and transparent banking solution with valuable tools for building long-term financial health. Dave also helps Members generate extra income for spending or emergencies through Dave’s Side Hustle and Surveys products, where Dave presents Members with supplemental work and income opportunities. ExtraCash: Many Americans are often unable to maintain a positive balance between paychecks, driving a reliance on bank overdraft products, payday loans, auto title loans and other forms of expensive credit to put food on the table, gas in their car or pay for unexpected emergencies. For example, traditional banks charge up to $ 35 for access to as little as $ 5 of overdraft, and many others in the financial services sector do not allow for overdraft at all. Dave invented a short-term liquidity alternative called ExtraCash, offered through our partnership with Evolve Bank & Trust, a federal reserve member bank and member of the FDIC (\"Evolve\"), which allows Members to receive via an overdraft of their deposit account with Evolve, up to $ 500 with an option to send their overdraft fu nds to an external bank account via the automated clearing house (ACH) network (which typically takes two to five business days) and avoid fees altogether. Members also have the option to send their funds to a Dave Checking account or to an external bank account via the debit card networks (which typically takes minutes or hours) for an instant transfer fee. Dave Banking: Dave offers a full-service digital checking account through our partnership with Evolve Bank & Trust. Dave Checking accounts do not have overdraft or minimum balance fees, allow for early paycheck payment, offer a Dave debit card to facilitate everyday spending and provide FDIC insurance on checking account balances up to $ 250,000 . Moreover, Dave Banking Members receive features to support their financial health such as 4.00 % annual percentage yield (\"APY\") deposit rates on both checking and Goals accounts and opt-in round-up savings on debit transactions in addition to receiving lower ExtraCash instant transfer fees. Budget: Leveraging our data connections to Members' bank accounts and spending activity, Dave offers a personal financial management tool to support Members with budgeting, wherever someone banks. With Budget, Dave helps Members to manage their income and expenses between paychecks and avoid liquidity jams that may cause them to overdraft. Dave tracks Members’ income and expenses, and we let them know about estimated upcoming bills and other expenses that are likely to impact their account balances. Budget will monitor their linked bank account held at a depository institution, including a Dave Banking account, and will let them know when they are in danger of having insufficient funds in their account. This helps Members avoid overdrafts, returned transactions and bank fees. Side Hustle and Surveys: Dave seeks to help Members improve their financial health by offering them opportunities to generate supplemental income through two channels: Side Hustle and Surveys. Through Side Hustle, our Members can quickly submit applications to leading employers, including Lyft, Instacart, and Walmart that can lead to increased income with flexible employment. Our Surveys product allows for additional earning opportunities, allowing Members to take paid surveys anytime within the Dave mobile application. These channels drive engagement within the Dave ecosystem and deepen our relationship to our Members’ financial well-being.",

ExtraCash receivables are treated as financial receivables under ASC 310 Receivables (“ASC 310”) and processing fees, net and tips are also accounted for in accordance with ASC 310. Processing Fees, Net: Processing fees apply when a Member requests expedited ExtraCash. At the Member’s election, the Company expedites the funding of ExtraCash funds within hours of the ExtraCash approval, as opposed to the customary two or three business days for ExtraCash that is transferred via the ACH network. Processing fees are accounted for as non-refundable loan origination fees and are recognized as revenues over the average expected contractual term of its ExtraCash transactions. Costs incurred by the Company to originate ExtraCash are treated as direct loan origination costs. These direct loan origination costs are netted against ExtraCash-related income over the average expected contractual term of an ExtraCash. Direct origination costs recognized as a reduction of ExtraCash-related income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $ 1.1 million and $ 2.6 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized direct origination costs as a reduction of ExtraCash-related income of $ 0.7 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively. Tips: The Company encourages, but does not contractually require its Members who receive ExtraCash to leave a discretionary tip. For accounting purposes, the Company treats tips as an adjustment of yield to ExtraCash and are recognized over the average expected contractual term of its ExtraCash receivables. Subscriptions: The Company accounts for subscriptions in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, the Company must identify the contract with a Member, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations. For revenue sources that are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company fully satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue in the period it is earned as services are rendered. Transaction prices are typically fixed, charged on a periodic basis or based on activity. Because performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying ASC 606 that significantly affects the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with the Company’s Members. Subscription fees are received on a monthly basis from Members who subscribe to the Company’s application. The Company continually fulfills its obligation to each Member over the subscription term.

Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Any related amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings (on a pre-tax basis). ExtraCash Receivables ExtraCash receivables include ExtraCash, fees and tips, net of certain direct origination costs and allowance for credit losses. Management’s intent is to hold ExtraCash receivables until the earlier of repayment or payoff date. Members’ ExtraCash receivables are treated as financial receivables under ASC 310. ExtraCash extended to Members is not interest-bearing. The Company recognizes ExtraCash at the origination amount and does not use discounting techniques to determine present value of originations due to their short-term nature. The Company does not provide modifications to ExtraCash and does not charge late fees. Allowance for Credit Losses ExtraCash receivables from contracts with Members as of the balance sheet dates are recorded at their original origination amounts, inclusive of outstanding processing fees and tips, and reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses. The Company pools its ExtraCash receivables, all of which are short-term (average term of approximately 11 days ) in nature and arise from contracts with Members, based on shared risk characteristics to assess their risk of loss, even when that risk is remote. The Company uses an aging method and historical loss rates as a basis for estimating the percentage of current and delinquent ExtraCash receivables balances that will result in credit losses to derive the allowance for credit losses. The Company considers whether the conditions at the measurement date and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future conditions warrant an adjustment to its historical loss experience. In assessing such adjustments, the Company primarily evaluates current economic conditions, expectations of near-term economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, collection trends and cash collections subsequent to the balance sheet date. For the measurement dates presented herein, given its methods of collecting funds, and that the Company has not observed meaningful changes in its customers’ payment behavior, it determined that its historical loss rates remain most indicative of its lifetime expected losses. The Company immediately recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses at the time of the ExtraCash origination. Adjustments to the allowance each period for changes in the estimate of lifetime expected credit losses are recognized in operating expenses—provision for credit losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. When the Company determines that an ExtraCash receivable is not collectible, or after 120 days from origination has passed, the uncollectible amount is written-off as a reduction to both the allowance and the gross asset balance. Based on the average outstanding ExtraCash receivable term of approximately 11 days, ExtraCash receivables outstanding 12 or more days from origination may be considered past due. Subsequent recoveries are recorded when received and are recorded as a recovery of the allowance for expected credit losses. Any change in circumstances related to a specific Member ExtraCash receivables may result in an additional allowance for expected credit losses being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. Internally Developed Software Internally developed software is capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized costs consist of salaries and other compensation costs for employees incurred for time spent on upgrades and enhancements to add functionality to the software and fees paid to third-party consultants who are directly involved in development efforts. These capitalized costs are included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets, net. Other costs are expensed as incurred and included within other operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Capitalized costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , were $ 1.7 million and $ 5.5 million, respectively. Capitalized costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $ 1.8 million and $ 5.9 million, respectively. Amortization of internally developed software commences when the software is ready for its intended use (i.e., after all substantial testing is complete). Internally developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of 3 years. The Company’s accounting policy is to perform annual reviews of capitalized internally developed software projects to determine whether any impairment indicators are present as of December 31, or whenever a change in circumstances suggests an impairment indicator is present. If any impairment indicators are present, the Company will perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributed to the asset group to their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining use of the asset (i.e., cash flows when testing recoverability) are less than the asset group’s carrying value,",

Amortization of internally developed software commences when the software is ready for its intended use (i.e., after all substantial testing is complete). Internally developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of 3 years. The Company’s accounting policy is to perform annual reviews of capitalized internally developed software projects to determine whether any impairment indicators are present as of December 31, or whenever a change in circumstances suggests an impairment indicator is present. If any impairment indicators are present, the Company will perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributed to the asset group to their carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining use of the asset (i.e., cash flows when testing recoverability) are less than the asset group’s carrying value,",

            "text": "the Company will determine the fair value of the asset group and recognize an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. If based on the results of the recoverability test, no impairment is indicated as the remaining undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the software asset group, the carrying value of the asset group as of the assessment date is deemed fully recoverable. In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset shall be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred and included within other operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company estimates the fair value of the assets. The Company measures the loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), provides a single definition of fair value and a common framework for measuring fair value as well as disclosure requirements for fair value measurements used in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Under ASC 820, fair value is determined based upon the exit price that would be received by a company to sell an asset or paid by a company to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, exclusive of any transaction costs. Fair value measurements are determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market. The principal market is the market with the greatest level of activity and volume for the asset or liability. Absent a principal market to measure fair value, the Company uses the most advantageous market, which is the market from which the Company would receive the highest selling price for the asset or pay the lowest price to settle the liability, after considering transaction costs. However, when using the most advantageous market, transaction costs are only considered to determine which market is the most advantageous and these costs are then excluded when applying a fair value measurement. ASC 820 creates a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values. The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2—Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active \t\tmarkets, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are \t\tobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3—Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement of the \t\tassets or liabilities. Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or \t\tliability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent \t\tin the inputs to the model . Concentration of Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, ExtraCash receivables, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limits were $ 34.3 million at September 30, 2024 and $ 40.9 million at December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company’s payment processors also collect cash on the Company’s behalf and will hold these cash balances temporarily until they are settled the next business day. Also, the Company does not believe its marketable securities are exposed to any significant credit risk due to the quality and nature of the securities in which the money is held.",

Advertising costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $ 13.9 million and $ 38.4 million, respectively. Income Taxes The Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the condensed consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more-likely-than-not that the asset will not be realized. The effective tax rate used for interim periods is the estimated annual effective tax rate, based on the current estimate of full year results, except that those taxes related to specific discrete events, if any, are recorded in the interim period in which they occur. The annual effective tax rate is based upon several significant estimates and judgments, including the estimated annual pre-tax income of the Company in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates, and the development of tax planning strategies during the year. In addition, the Company’s tax expense can be impacted by changes in tax rates or laws and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, there can be significant volatility in interim tax provisions. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained in a court of last resort, based on the technical merits. If more-likely-than-not, the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized on examination, including compromise settlements. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company has estimated $ 1.8 million and $ 1.3 million of uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to state income taxes and federal and state research tax credits. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense within the statement of operations. The Company recognized $ 0.004 million of interest expense and penalties as a component of income tax expense during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Segment Information The Company determines its operating segments based on how its chief operating decision makers manage operations, make operating decisions, and evaluate operating performance. The Company has determined that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is a joint role shared by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon the way the CODM reviews financial information and makes operating decisions and considering that the CODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance, the service-based and transaction-based operations constitute a single operating segment and reportable segment. Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Stockholders The Company has two classes of participating securities (Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock) issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Basic net income (loss) attributable to holders of Common Stock per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to holders of Common Stock by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to holders of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) per share attributable to stockholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and the effect of potentially dilutive stock options, warrants, and restricted stock using the treasury stock method.",

The gain recorded in connection with the investment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $ 0.2 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively. Accrued interest of $ 0.1 million and $ 1.0 million is included in investments within the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Unrealized losses on the available-for-sale investment securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are primarily the result of increases in interest rates as a significant portion of the investments were purchased prior to the Federal Reserve commenced interest rate increases in 2022. The Company does not intend to sell nor anticipate that it will be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost basis. As such, unrealized losses were determined not to be related to credit losses and the Company did not record any credit-related impairment losses on the available-for-sale investment securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

No fractional Public Warrants were issued upon separation of the units into their component parts upon the closing of the Business Combination and only whole Public Warrants trade. The Public Warrants are exercisable, provided that the Company continues to have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company filed a registration statement covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and the Private Warrants. If the Company’s shares of Class A Common Stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. The Public Warrants and the Private Warrants have an exercise price of $ 368 per share, subject to adjustments and will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Redemption of Public Warrants when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $ 576.00 : Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants for cash:          in whole and not in part;",

The Company will not redeem the Public Warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A Common Stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. Redemption of Public Warrants for when the price per share of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $ 320.00 : Once the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:          in whole and not in part;         at $ 0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined below) of the Class A Common Stock; and         if, and only if, the closing price of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $ 320.00 per Public Share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within the 30 -trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Class A Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings Sponsor III, LLC, which was the sponsor of VPCC and an affiliate of certain of VPCC’s officers and directors prior to the Business Combination, (the “Sponsor”) or its permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Debt Facility, the Company issued warrants to the Lenders as consideration for entering into the Debt Facility, representing a loan commitment fee. The warrants vest and become exercisable based on the Company’s aggregated draw on the Debt Facility in incremental $ 10.0 million tranches and terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of the occurrence of a qualified financing event and (ii) the consummation of a liquidity event. The holders of the warrants have the ability to exercise their right to acquire a number of common shares equal to 0.2 % of the fully diluted equity of the Company as of the closing date (“Equity Closing Date”) of the Company’s next equity financing with proceeds of at least $ 40.0 million (“Qualified Financing Event”) or immediately prior to the consummation of a liquidity event. The exercise price of the warrants is the greater of (i) 80 % of the fair market value of each share of Common Stock at the Equity Closing Date and (ii) $ 120.0656 per share, subject to certain down-round adjustments. The warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 and will be accounted for as a liability at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The initial offsetting entry to the warrant liability was an asset recorded to reflect the loan commitment fee. The loan commitment fee asset will be amortized to interest expense over the commitment period of four years. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at the issuance date to be $ 0.1 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Determining the fair value of these warrants under this model requires subjective assumptions. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. Immediately prior to the close of the Business Combination, all, or 1,664,394 of the vested warrants were exercised and net settled for 14,087 shares of Legacy Dave’s Class A Common Stock after applying the exchange ratio.",

The Debt Facility had an interest rate of 6.95 % annually plus a base rate defined as the greater of the three-month London interbank offered rate (\"LIBOR\") as of the last business day of each calendar month and 2.55 % . Interest is payable monthly in arrears. The Debt Facility contained certain financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities balance of $ 8.0 million. On September 13, 2023, the Company executed the Third Amendment to the Debt Facility with the existing Lenders. The Third Amendment, among other things: (i) increases the secured loan facility commitment amount by $ 50.0 million to a total of $ 150.0 million; (ii) extends the maturity date of the Debt Facility from January 2025 to December 2026 ; (iii) adds a liquidity trigger threshold, measured as of the last day of any calendar month, equal to the lesser of (a) the trailing six-month EBITDA as of such date, (b) the product of (A) the trailing three-month EBITDA as of such date, multiplied by (B) two (2), and (c) zero ($0); (iv) increases the minimum liquidity threshold, a requirement to maintain a minimum cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities balance, from $ 8.0 million to $ 15.0 million; (v) replaces LIBOR with the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\") and updates interest rates to the base rate (or if greater, SOFR for such date for a 3-month tenor and 3.00 %) plus 5.00 % per annum on that portion of the aggregate outstanding principal balance that is less than or equal to $75.0 million, plus the base rate plus 4.50 % per annum on that portion of the aggregate outstanding principal balance, if any, that is greater than $75.0 million; (vi) updates prepayment premiums for early or voluntary principal repayments; and (vii) the Company's guaranty (the limited guaranty was secured by a first-priority lien against substantially all of the Company's assets) of up to $ 25,000,000 of the Borrower's obligations under the Debt Facility has been terminated. Payments of the loan draws are due at the following dates: (i) within five business days after the date of receipt by the Borrower of any net cash proceeds in excess of $ 0.25 million in the aggregate during any fiscal year from any asset sales (other than certain permitted dispositions), Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 100 % of such net cash proceeds; (ii) within five business days after the date of receipt by Borrower, or the Agent as loss payee, of any net cash proceeds from any destruction or taking, the Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such net cash proceeds; (iii) within three business days after the date of receipt by Borrower of any net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness of Borrower (other than with respect to permitted borrower indebtedness), the Borrower will prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to 100 % of such net cash proceeds; and (iv) (a) if extraordinary receipts are received by Borrower in the aggregate amount in any fiscal year in excess of $ 0.25 million or (b) if an event of default has occurred and is continuing at any time when any extraordinary receipts are received by Borrower, then within five business days of the receipt by Borrower of any such extraordinary receipts, the Borrower must prepay the loans or remit such net cash proceeds in an aggregate amount equal to (x) 100 % of such extraordinary receipts in excess of $ 0.25 million in respect of clause (a) above and (y) 100 % of such extraordinary receipts in respect of clause (b) above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had drawn $ 75.0 million on the Debt Facility and had made no repayments. The Third Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification and, accordingly, the Company capitalized $ 0.4 million of financing costs which will be recognized within the statement of operations evenly through maturity date of the Debt Facility, no gain or loss was recognized. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.",

(filed November 5, 2024 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California) In January 2023, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) staff seeking information in connection with the sale, offering, advertising, marketing or other promotion of cash advance products and online financial services. In response, the Company cooperated with the FTC staff while seeking to engage constructively with the FTC to resolve this matter. On August 21, 2024, the FTC staff sent the Company a proposed consent order and draft complaint, alleging that the Company had violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and certain provisions of the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act related to the Company’s platform and offering of the ExtraCash Product (the “Complaint”), and advising that it would recommend the filing of an enforcement action if the Company did not settle the FTC’s claims. The Company engaged in good faith negotiations with the FTC staff to settle the claims but these negotiations were unsuccessful, and on November 5, 2024, the FTC filed the Complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company. The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, monetary relief for an unspecified amount and “other relief as the court determines to be just and proper.” Although the Company believes that its practices have at all times been in compliance with applicable law, the outcome of any case in litigation is uncertain. Therefore, for the period ending September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a $ 7 million litigation and settlement accrual for this matter. Significant changes in the accrual may be required in future periods as the case progresses and additional information becomes available. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict the possible outcome of this matter due to, among other things, the fact that it raises difficult factual and legal issues and is subject to many uncertainties and complexities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the litigation, and the Company may incur a loss in excess of the amount accrued. The defense or resolution of this matter could involve significant monetary costs and have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial results and operations. 2. Lopez v. Dave Inc.

The Company also has financial instruments not measured at fair value. The Company has evaluated cash (Level 1), restricted cash (Level 1), accounts payable (Level 2), accrued expenses (Level 2) and ExtraCash receivables (Level 3) and believes the carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short-term nature of these balances. The fair value of the debt facility (Level 2) approximates its carrying value. Marketable Securities: The Company evaluated the quoted market prices in active markets for its marketable securities and has classified its securities as Level 1. The Company’s investments in marketable securities are exposed to price fluctuations. The fair value measurements for the securities are based upon the quoted prices of similar items in active markets multiplied by the number of securities owned. Investments: The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure the fair value of investments held as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. U.S. Government Securities The fair value of U.S. government securities is estimated by independent pricing services who use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values. U.S. government securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Corporate Bonds and Notes The fair value of corporate bonds and notes is estimated by independent pricing services who use computerized valuation formulas to calculate current values. These securities are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy or in Level 3 when market-based transaction activity is unavailable and significant unobservable inputs are used.",

The Company recognized $ 13.4 million and $ 27.2 million of stock-based compensation expense arising from stock option, restricted stock unit grants and performance-based restricted stock unit grants which is recorded as a component of compensation and benefits in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized $ 6.7 million and $ 20.1 million of stock based compensation expense arising from stock option and restricted stock unit grants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Stock Options: Management has valued stock options at their date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the underlying shares was estimated by using a number of inputs, including recent arm’s length transactions involving the sale of the Company’s common stock. Expected term —The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. As the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise behavior, it determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its vesting period. Risk free interest rate —The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the options depending on the date of the grant and expected life of the options. Expected dividend yield —The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. Expected volatility —Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical or implied volatility, the expected volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The Company identified a group of peer companies and considered their historical stock prices. In identifying peer companies, the Company considered the industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage of such other entities. Activity with respect to stock options is summarized as follows: Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Options outstanding, January 1, 2024 766,829 $ 14.10 6.3 $ 1,148 Granted - $ - Exercised ( 133,891 ) $ 6.68 Forfeited ( 6,389 ) $ 6.34 Expired ( 3,600 ) $ 5.18 Options outstanding, September 30, 2024 622,949 $ 15.82 6.0 15,036 Nonvested options, September 30, 2024 366,597 $ 22.77 6.4 6,303 Vested and exercisable, September 30, 2024 256,352 $ 5.90 5.4 8,732 At September 30, 2024, total estimated unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options prior to that date was $ 2.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of 3.0 years. On March 3, 2021, the Company granted the Chief Executive Officer stock options to purchase up to 358,001 shares of Common Stock in nine tranches. Each of the nine tranches contain service, market and performance conditions. The market conditions relate to the achievement of certain specified price targets. Vesting commences on the grant date; however, no compensation charges are recognized until the service and performance condition are probable, which is upon the completion of a liquidity event, the achievement of specified price targets for each tranche of shares, and continuous employment. Upon the completion of the Business Combination, the performance condition was met and the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 1.9 million. The options have a strike price of $ 23.18 per share. The Company determined the fair value of the options on the grant date to be $ 10.5 million using a Monte Carlo simulation with key inputs and assumptions such as stock price, term, dividend yield, risk-free",

As a result, the exercise price for these awards was lowered to $ 5.18 per share, which was the average per share closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Stock Market for the 30 trading days ending on and including June 9, 2023. No other terms of the repriced stock options were modified, and the repriced stock options will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedules and will retain their original expiration dates. As a result of the repricing, 134,931 vested and unvested stock options outstanding as of June 9, 2023, with original exercise prices ranging from $ 22.09 to $ 23.18 , were repriced. The repricing on June 9, 2023 resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $ 0.2 million, of which $ 0.1 million related to vested stock option awards was expensed on the repricing date. The remaining $ 0.1 million related to unvested stock option awards is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average vesting period of those awards of approximately 1.3 years as of June 9, 2023. In September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repricing of certain previously granted and still outstanding vested and unvested stock option awards held by eight remaining eligible employees excluded from the aforementioned June 9th repricing. As a result, the exercise price for these awards was lowered to $ 7.23 per share, which was the average per share closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Stock Market for the 30 trading days ending on and including September 13, 2023. No other terms of the repriced stock options were modified, and the repriced stock options will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedules and will retain their original expiration dates. As a result of the repricing, 200,571 vested and unvested stock options outstanding as of September 13, 2023, with original exercise prices ranging from $ 22.09 to $ 23.18 , were repriced. The repricing on September 13, 2023 resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $ 0.2 million, of which $ 0.17 million related to vested stock option awards was expensed on the repricing date. The remaining $ 0.07 million related to unvested stock option awards is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the weighted-average vesting period of those awards of approximately 1.0 years as of September 13, 2023.

The performance-based RSUs are subject to the attainment of defined performance and service conditions, such as the Company's trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA and specific share price targets, both subject to continued employment with the Company through certain dates. The actual number of shares subject to the award is determined at the end of the performance period and may range from 0 % to 150 % of the target shares granted depending upon the terms of the award. Activity with respect to Performance-Based RSUs is summarized as follows: Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding shares at January 1, 2024 - $ - Granted 516,316 $ 34.14 Vested - $ - Forfeited ( 15,188 ) $ 33.90 Outstanding shares at September 30, 2024 501,128 $ 34.14 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company achieved certain performance conditions as outlined in its grant agreements and recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of approximately $ 5.6 million. Additionally , a total of 318,087 performance-based RSUs were subject to vesting as of September 30, 2024 and will be considered vested and subsequently issued to participants based upon the achievement of the remaining service requirements as outlined in the award agreements. At September 30, 2024, total estimated unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested performance-based RSUs was approximately $ 9.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.",

The Company recognizes in the condensed consolidated financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements do not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet but arose after the condensed consolidated balance sheet date and before the condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. On October 18, 2024, the Company amended its Debt Facility with Victory Park Management, LLC. The amendment increased the advance rate within the facility by 250 basis points and it adjusted eligibility criteria and concentration limits to expand borrowing capacity. There is no impact to the cost of funds on the $ 75 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and the cost of any future draws will remain at the same spread over the benchmark rate. The facility size and maturity remain unchanged at $ 150 million and December 15, 2026, respectively. On November 5, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) filed a civil complaint against us alleging violations of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act related to our platform and offering of our ExtraCash product. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, monetary relief for an unspecified amount and “other relief as the court determines to be just and proper.” Given the outcome of any case in litigation is uncertain, for the period ending September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a $ 7 million litigation and settlement accrual for this matter. Significant changes in the accrual may be required in future periods as the case progresses and additional information becomes available.",
