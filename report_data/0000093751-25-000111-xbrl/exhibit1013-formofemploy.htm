<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Employment (Change of Control) Agreement  AGREEMENT by and between State Street Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;),  and  (the &#8220;Executive&#8221;), dated as of                      .  The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) has determined that it is in the best interests of  the Company and its shareholders to [do everything necessary to] assure that the Company will have the  continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of  Control (as defined in Section 2) of the Company.  The Board believes that it is imperative to diminish the  inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending  or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executive&#8217;s full attention and dedication to the  Company Group (as defined in Section 1) currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of  Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of  Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be addressed  appropriately.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board caused the Company to enter  into this Agreement.  NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:  1. Certain Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6, the terms described in Sections 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c) shall have the meanings set forth therein:  (a) The &#8220;Effective Date&#8221; shall mean the first date during the Change of Control Period (as defined in Section 1(b)) on which a Change of Control occurs.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding, if a Change of Control occurs and if the Executive&#8217;s employment with the Company Group is  terminated prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by  the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps  reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation  of a Change of Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221; shall mean the date  immediately prior to the date of such termination of employment.   (b) The &#8220;Change of Control Period&#8221; shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on                      ; provided, however, that commencing on  , and on each annual  anniversary of such date (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter referred to as  the &#8220;Renewal Date&#8221;), unless previously terminated, the Change of Control Period shall be automatically  extended so as to terminate two years from such Renewal Date, unless at least 60 days prior to the Renewal  Date the Company shall give notice to the Executive that the Change of Control Period shall not be so  extended.   (c) The &#8220;Company Group&#8221; shall mean the Company and any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.  2. Change of Control.  For the purpose of this Agreement, a &#8220;Change of Control&#8221; shall mean: (a) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)) (a  &#8220;Person&#8221;) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of  25% or more of either (i) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the &#8220;Outstanding  Company Common Stock&#8221;) or (ii) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the  Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the &#8220;Outstanding Company Voting  Securities&#8221;); provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (a), the following acquisitions shall not  constitute a Change of Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company, (B) any acquisition by the  Company, (C) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the  Company or any corporation controlled by the Company or (D) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to  a transaction which complies with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (c) of this Section 2; or   (b) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the &#8220;Incumbent Board&#8221;) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual  becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the  Company&#8217;s shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the  Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but  excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an  Exhibit 10.13 </FONT></DIV>

During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed no more than 12  months after the last salary increase awarded to the Executive prior to the Effective Date and thereafter at  least annually.

Each such Annual Bonus shall be paid in a single lump sum  in cash no later than March 15th of the year succeeding the year for which the Annual Bonus is earned, unless  the Executive shall elect to defer receipt of such Annual Bonus in accordance with the requirements of  Section 409A of the Code.

(a) Death or Disability.  The Executive&#8217;s employment shall terminate automatically upon  the Executive&#8217;s death during the Employment Period.  If the Company determines in good faith that the  Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability  set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 14(b) of its intention  to terminate the Executive&#8217;s employment.  In such event, the Executive&#8217;s employment with the Company  Group shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the &#8220;Disability  Effective Date&#8221;); provided that, within the 30 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to  full-time performance of the Executive&#8217;s duties.  For purposes of this Agreement, &#8220;Disability&#8221; shall mean the  absence of the Executive from the Executive&#8217;s duties with the Company Group on a full-time basis for  180 consecutive days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be  total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the Executive  or the Executive&#8217;s legal representative.   (b) Cause.  The Company may terminate the Executive&#8217;s employment during the  Employment Period for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, &#8220;Cause&#8221; shall mean:   (i)   the willful and continued failure of the Executive to perform substantially the  Executive&#8217;s duties with the Company Group (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to  physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive  by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which  the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the  Executive&#8217;s duties; or   (ii)   the willful engaging by the Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that  is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.   For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered  &#8220;willful&#8221; unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that  the Executive&#8217;s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based  upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief  Executive Officer of the Company or a senior officer of the Company who is a member of the Company&#8217;s  executive management committee or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be  conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best  interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for  Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted  by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of  the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the  Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the  </FONT></DIV>

For purposes of this Agreement, &#8220;Good Reason&#8221; shall mean:   (i)   the assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent in any  respect with the Executive&#8217;s position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority,  duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 4(a), or any other action by the Company Group which  results in a material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose  an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company  Group promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive; or  (ii)   any failure by the Company Group to comply with any of the provisions of  Section 4(b), other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which  is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive; or  (iii)   the Company&#8217;s requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location  other than as provided in Section 4(a)(i)(B) or the Company&#8217;s requiring the Executive to travel on Company  business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date; or  (iv)   any purported termination by the Company Group of the Executive&#8217;s  employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or   (v)   any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 13(c).   For purposes of this Section 5(c), any good faith determination of &#8220;Good Reason&#8221; made by the  Executive shall be conclusive.   (d)  Resignation without Good Reason.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  the contrary, following the Effective Date, the Executive may, voluntarily, terminate his employment without  Good Reason during the Employment Period.  (e) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by the  Executive for Good Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given  in accordance with Section 14(b).

The failure by the Executive or  the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a  showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively,  hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance  in enforcing the Executive&#8217;s or the Company&#8217;s rights hereunder.   (f) Date of Termination.  &#8220;Date of Termination&#8221; means (i) if the Executive&#8217;s employment  is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the  Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be; (ii) if the Executive&#8217;s  employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be  the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination; and (iii) if the Executive&#8217;s  employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death  of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.   [for German employees: (g) Local laws:  The above mentioned provisions are subject  to local laws.

Full Settlement.  The Company&#8217;s obligation to make the payments provided for in this  Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off,  counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the  Executive or others, except as required by applicable law or regulation.

For the purposes of this Section 9, (i) &#8220;Parachute Value of the  Payments&#8221; shall mean the present value, as of the Effective Date, for purposes of Section 280G of the Code  of the portion of such Payments that constitutes a &#8220;parachute payment&#8221; under Section 280G(b)(2), as  determined by the Accounting Firm (as defined in Section 9(c)) for purposes of determining whether and to  what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payments, and (ii) &#8220;Safe Harbor Amount&#8221; shall mean the  maximum Parachute Value of the Payments that the Executive can receive without any Payments being  subject to the Excise Tax.  (c) If it shall be determined that the Parachute Value of the Payments is greater than  110% of the Safe Harbor Amount, then the value of the Payments to be made to the Executive shall be either  (i) subject to a Cutback or (ii) delivered in full, whichever of the foregoing results in the receipt by the  Executive of the greatest benefit on an after-tax basis (taking into account the Executive&#8217;s actual marginal  rate of federal, state and local income taxation and the Excise Tax).  (d) All determinations required to be made under this Section 9, including whether and  when a Cutback is required and the amount of such Cutback and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at  such determination, shall be made by Ernst &amp; Young LLP or such other nationally recognized certified public  accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the &#8220;Accounting Firm&#8221;); provided that such  Accounting Firm shall be independent of the Executive.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as  accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, the Executive shall  appoint another independent nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required  hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and  expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any determination by the  Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.  The Accounting Firm shall make the  determinations required under this Section 9 on a preliminary basis and provide to both the Company and the  Executive the detailed supporting calculations on an initial basis, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to  the making of any Payment, but in no event later than 10 days prior to the Effective Date.  Thereafter, the  Accounting Firm shall timely make any further determinations as may be required under this Section 9 and  provide to both the Company and the Executive additional detailed supporting calculations as necessary or  appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 9.

(c) During the term of employment of the Executive and following the termination  thereof, the Executive shall cooperate with the Company with respect to any matters arising during or related  to the Executive&#8217;s employment with the Company Group, including but not limited to any litigation,  governmental investigation, or regulatory or other proceeding which may have arisen as of or which may arise  following the execution of this Agreement.

For purposes of this  Section 10, the term &#8220;Nonsolicitation Period&#8221; means the period beginning on the date of termination of the  Executive&#8217;s employment with the Company Group (the &#8220;Termination Date&#8221;) and ending on the earlier of (i) 18  months after the Termination Date and (ii) one year after the Effective Date (if any).  If the Executive violates  a restriction to which the Nonsolicitation Period applies under this Section 10(d) or 10(e), then the  Nonsolicitation Period shall be extended, with respect only to the restriction violated by the Executive, by the  amount of time for which the Executive was out of compliance with such restriction.

For the purposes of this Section 10(c), the term &#8220;Solicitation of Business&#8221; shall mean the attempt  through direct personal contact on the part of the Executive with a Client with whom the Executive has had  significant personal contact while serving in a Line-Function Capacity (as defined below) during his period of  employment to induce such Client to transfer its business relationship from the Company and its subsidiaries  to any other person or entity.  The term &#8220;Line-Function Capacity&#8221; means service to the Company and its  subsidiaries in a primary capacity other than a staff function, in which the Executive has direct and regular  contact with Clients and responsibility for managing the business relationship of the Company and its  subsidiaries with such Clients.  During the Nonsolicitation Period, the Executive may accept employment with  or enter into a business relationship with a person or entity that has or seeks to establish business  relationships with one or more Clients provided that the Executive does not engage in the Solicitation of  Business from such Clients and does not disclose confidential information concerning such Client and its  relationship with the Company and its subsidiaries to any such person or entity.]   (f)  In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 10 constitute  a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

Therefore, the Executive agrees that the Company or any of its  subsidiaries shall, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this  Section 10, in addition to such other remedies as may be available, be entitled to specific performance and  injunctive relief without posting a bond.

If any restriction set forth in this Section 10 is found by  any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or  over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only  over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.   [for U.S. employees: The restrictions on solicitation found under Section 10 shall not apply if Executive resides  in or has a primary reporting location in California, USA.    (k)    Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of  federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or regulatory authority or from making other disclosures  that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of Federal law or regulation. Moreover, nothing in this  Agreement requires Executive to notify the Company that Executive has made any such report or disclosure.   However, in connection with any such activity, Executive must take reasonable precautions to ensure that  any confidential information that is disclosed to such authority is not made generally available to the public,  including by informing such authority of the confidentiality of the same.     (l)    Executive shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or state  trade secret law if Executive discloses a Company or a Company affiliated organization trade secret (i) in  confidence to a Federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney,  solely for the purposes of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other  document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.     (m)      Despite the foregoing, Executive is not permitted to disclose to any third-party,  including any governmental or regulatory authority, any information learned in the course of his or her  employment that is protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to the  attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the bank examiner&#8217;s privilege, and/or privileges  applicable to information covered by the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 5311-5330), including information  that would reveal the existence or contemplated filing of a suspicious activity report. The Company and its  affiliated organizations do not waive any applicable privileges or the right to continue to protect its or their  privileged attorney-client information, attorney work product, and other privileged information.]    11.
