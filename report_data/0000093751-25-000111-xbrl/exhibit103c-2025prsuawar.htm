However, nothing in this Agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing  information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any  other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.  16.

You acknowledge and agree that the promises contained in this Agreement are reasonable and  necessary to the protection of the legitimate business interests of your Employer, the Company  and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation its and their Confidential Information, trade  secrets and goodwill, and are material and integral to the undertakings of the Company under this  Award. You further agree that one or more of your Employer, the Company and its Subsidiaries  will be irreparably harmed in the event you do not perform such promises in accordance with their  specific terms or otherwise breach the promises made herein.

If any restriction set forth in this Agreement is  found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long  a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall  be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic  area as to which it may be enforceable.  20. Assignment.  Except as provided otherwise herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the  benefit of both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any person or entity  which acquires the Company or its assets or business; provided, however, that your obligations  are personal and may not be assigned by you.   21. Certain Limitations.  (a) Nothing in this Agreement prohibits you from reporting possible violations of law or  regulation to any governmental, law enforcement, self-regulatory, or regulatory agency or  authority or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions  of applicable law or regulation. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement requires you to notify the  Company that you have made any such report or disclosure. However, in connection with any  such activity, you acknowledge you must take reasonable precautions to ensure that any  Confidential Information that is disclosed to such authority is not made generally available to the  public, including by informing such authority of the confidentiality of the same.  (b) You shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade  secret law if you disclose a Company trade secret:   (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly  or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the purposes of reporting or investigating a  suspected violation of law; or   (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if  such filing is made under seal.

Regardless of any action your Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax (including  U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, fringe  benefits tax, or payment on account of other tax-related withholding (&#8220;Tax-Related Items&#8221;), you  acknowledge and agree that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due from you is  and remains your responsibility. Furthermore, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (a) makes  any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in  connection with any aspect of this Award, including the grant of this Award, the vesting of this  Award and the issuance of shares of Common Stock in settlement of this Award, the subsequent  sale of any shares of Common Stock delivered upon settlement of this Award, the cancellation,  forfeiture or repayment of any shares of Common Stock (or cash in lieu thereof) or the receipt of  any dividends or dividend equivalents; or (b) commits to structure the terms of the grant, vesting,  settlement, cancellation, forfeiture, repayment or any other aspect of this Award to reduce or  eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items.  Prior to the delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the vesting of this Award, if any taxing  jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items in connection with the Award, the Company  may withhold a sufficient number of whole shares of Common Stock that have an aggregate fair  market value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to this  Award. The cash equivalent of the shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the  obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined in the Company&#8217;s and/or Employer&#8217;s  reasonable discretion). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be withheld or issued pursuant  to the issuance of Common Stock hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and/or your Employer  may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from your  salary, wages or other amounts payable to you, with no withholding in shares of Common Stock.  In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of shares or  through your salary, wages or other amounts payable to you, no shares of Common Stock will be  issued upon vesting of this Award unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by  the Company or your Employer) have been made by you with respect to the payment of any Tax- Related Items which the Company or your Employer determines, in its sole discretion, must be  withheld or collected with respect to such Award.  Depending on the withholding method, the Company and/or your Employer may withhold for Tax- Related Items by considering any applicable statutory withholding amounts or other applicable  withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates. If you are subject to taxation in more than  one jurisdiction, you hereby expressly acknowledge that the Company, your Employer or another  Subsidiary may be required to withhold and/or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one  jurisdiction.  By accepting this Award, you hereby expressly consent to the withholding of shares of Common  Stock and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to this Award  and any Common Stock delivered in payment thereof, including the extent to which the Company  or your Employer does not so-withhold shares of Common Stock and/or cash, are your sole  responsibility.   23. Changes in Capitalization or Corporate Structure.  This Award is subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Plan in the circumstances  therein described.  </FONT></DIV>

Nothing in this Award shall be construed to guarantee you any right of employment with the  Company or any Subsidiary or to limit the discretion of any of them to terminate your employment  at any time to the maximum extent permitted under local law.   In consideration of the grant of the Award, you acknowledge and agree that you will have no  entitlement to compensation or damages in consequence of the termination of your employment  (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of contract or local labor laws), insofar  as such entitlement arises or may arise from your ceasing to have rights under or to be entitled  to the Award as a result of such termination, or from the loss or diminution in value of the Award.  By accepting this Award, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any such claim or  entitlement against the Company and all Subsidiaries that may arise; if, notwithstanding the  foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by  accepting this Agreement, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to  pursue such claim. In the event your employment ends and you are subsequently rehired by the  Company or any Subsidiary, no Award previously forfeited or recovered will be reinstated.  25. Non-Transferability, Etc.  This Award shall not be transferable other than (1) by will or the laws of descent and distribution  or (2) pursuant to the terms of a court-approved domestic relations order, official marital  settlement agreement or other divorce or settlement instrument satisfactory to State Street, in its  sole discretion. In the case of transfer pursuant to (2) above, this Award shall remain subject to  all the terms and conditions contained in the Plan and this Agreement, including vesting, forfeiture  and clawback terms and conditions. Any attempt by you (or in the case of your death, by your  Designated Beneficiary) to assign or transfer this Award, either voluntarily or involuntarily,  contrary to the provisions hereof, shall be null, void and without effect and shall render this Award  itself null and void.  26. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.    (a) The provisions of this Award are intended to be exempt from, or compliant with,  Section 409A of the Code, and shall be construed and interpreted consistently therewith.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have any liability to  you or to any other person if this Award is not so exempt or compliant.  (b) If and to the extent   (i) any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to you  pursuant to the Plan in connection with your employment termination constitutes  &#8220;nonqualified deferred compensation&#8221; within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code,  and  (ii) you are a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the  Code, in each case as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by  which determinations you (through accepting this Award) agree that you are bound, such  portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that  is six (6) months plus one day after the date of &#8220;separation from service&#8221; (as determined  under Section 409A of the Code) (the &#8220;New Payment Date&#8221;), except as Section 409A of  the Code may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have  been paid to you during the period between the date of separation from service and the  New Payment Date shall be paid to you in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and  any remaining payments will be paid on their original deferral schedule.  </FONT></DIV>

By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree  that the Plan is discretionary in nature and limited in duration, and may be amended, cancelled,  forfeited, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of this Award  is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive an award,  compensation or benefits in lieu of an award in the future. Future awards, if any, will be at the sole  discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of an award, the  number of shares of Common Stock subject to an award, performance criteria, and forfeiture,  clawback and vesting provisions.  (b) Company and Board Discretion.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement  are intended to comply with and meet the requirements of applicable law and related  implementing regulations regarding incentive compensation and will be interpreted and  administered accordingly as well as in accordance with any implementing policies and practices  of the Company or its relevant Subsidiaries in effect from time to time. In making determinations  under such Sections, the Company, the relevant Subsidiary or the Board, as applicable, may take  into account, in its sole discretion, all factors that it deems appropriate or relevant. Furthermore,  the Company, the relevant Subsidiary or the Board may, as applicable, take any and all actions it  deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, as permitted by applicable law, to  implement the intent of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, including suspension of vesting and payment  pending an investigation or the determination by the Company, the relevant Subsidiary or the  Board, as applicable. Each such Section is without prejudice to the provisions of the other  Sections, and the Company, the relevant Subsidiary or the Board, as applicable, may elect or be  required to apply any or all of the provisions of Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 to this Award. Sections  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement shall cease to apply upon your death at any time provided,  however, if a UK Clawback Event, SSBI Identified Staff Clawback Event, a EC/EVP Clawback  Event or a EC/EVP Clawback Breach has occurred pursuant to Section 6, 7 or 8, respectively, at  or prior to your death, any amount that the Board has made a determination to recover under  such Section shall continue to be payable to the Company.

Exchange Control Restrictions.  You understand and agree that, if you are subject to  exchange control laws in China, you will be required immediately to repatriate to China the  proceeds from the sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan. You further  understand that such repatriation of proceeds shall be effected through a special bank account  established by the Company, and you hereby consent and agree that proceeds from the sale of  shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan may be transferred to such account by the  Company on your behalf prior to being delivered to you and that no interest shall be paid with  respect to funds held in such account. The proceeds may be paid to you in U.S. dollars or local  currency at the Company&#8217;s discretion. If the proceeds are paid to you in U.S. dollars, you  understand that a U.S. dollar bank account in China must be established and maintained so that  the proceeds may be deposited into such account. If the proceeds are paid to you in local  currency, you acknowledge that the Company is under no obligation to secure any particular  exchange conversion rate and that the Company may face delays in converting the proceeds to  local currency due to exchange control restrictions. You agree to bear any currency fluctuation  risk between the time the shares of Common Stock are sold and the net proceeds are converted  into local currency and distributed to you. You further agree to comply with any other requirements  that may be imposed by the Company in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange  control requirements in China.  4.

By accepting the Award of Restricted Stock Units, you  expressly acknowledge that, pursuant to Article 15 of Law 50/1990 (Article 128 of the Colombian  Labor Code), the Restricted Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock you receive pursuant  to the Restricted Stock Units are wholly discretionary and are a benefit of an extraordinary nature  that do not exclusively depend on your performance.  Accordingly, the Plan, the value of the  Restricted Stock Units or any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan and any related  benefits do not constitute a component of your &#8220;salary&#8221; for any legal purpose, including for the  purposes of calculating any and all labor benefits, such as fringe benefits, vacation pay,  termination or other indemnities, payroll taxes, social insurance contributions or any outstanding  employment-related amounts, subject to limitations provided in Law 1393/2010.    2. Securities Law Notice.  The shares of Common Stock are not and will not be registered  in the Colombian registry of publicly traded securities (Registro Vacional de Valores y Emisores)  and therefore the shares of Common Stock may not be offered to the public in Colombia.  Nothing  in this document should be construed as the making of a public offer of securities in Colombia.   An offer of shares of Common Stock to employees will not be considered a public offer provided  that it meets conditions set forth in Decree 1351, 2019.    3. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information.  An annual informative return must be  filed with the Colombian Tax Office detailing any assets held abroad (including any shares of  Common Stock acquired under the Plan).

Labor Law Acknowledgement and Policy Statement.  In accepting any Award granted  hereunder, you expressly recognize that the Company, with registered offices at One Congress  Street, Boston, MA 02114, USA, is solely responsible for the administration of the Plan and that  your participation in the Plan and acquisition of shares of Common Stock do not constitute an  employment relationship between you and the Company since you are participating in the Plan  on a wholly commercial basis and your sole Employer is a Mexican legal entity that employs you  (&#8220;State Street-Mexico&#8221;). Based on the foregoing, you expressly recognize that the Plan and the  benefits that you may derive from participation in the Plan do not establish any rights between  you and the Employer, State Street-Mexico, and do not form part of the employment conditions  and/or benefits provided by State Street-Mexico and any modification of the Plan or its termination  shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of your employment.  You further understand that your participation in the Plan is as a result of a unilateral and  discretionary decision of the Company; therefore, the Company reserves the absolute right to  amend and/or discontinue your participation in the Plan at any time without any liability to you.

It is a condition of this Award that, if you  fail to comply with the terms and conditions below, then the Company may in its absolute  discretion determine that any or all of the amounts remaining to be paid under this Award should  be forfeited.  All terms used herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Plan or this Award, except as  otherwise expressly provided.  1. Income Tax and Social Insurance Contribution Withholding.  Without limitation to  Section 22 of the Agreement, you hereby agree that you are liable for any or all income tax,  national insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, or payment on account of other tax-related  withholding (&#8220;Tax-Related Items&#8221;) and hereby consent to pay all such Tax-Related Items, as and  when requested by the Company and or your Employer (if different) or by HM Revenue &amp; Customs  (&#8220;HMRC&#8221;) (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). You also hereby agree to  indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and your Employer (if different) against any Tax- Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold on your behalf or have paid or will pay to  HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if you are a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of  the Exchange Act), you understand that you may not be able to indemnify the Company for the  amount of any income tax not collected from or paid by you within ninety (90) days of the end of  the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Items occurs as it may be  considered to be a loan and therefore, it may constitute a benefit to you on which additional  income tax and National Insurance contributions (&#8220;NICs&#8221;) may be payable. You understand that  you will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit  directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying to the Company and/or your  Employer (as appropriate) the amount of any NICs due on this additional benefit, which may also  be recovered from you by any of the means referred to in Section 22 of the Agreement.  2. Exclusion of Claim.  You acknowledge and agree that you will have no entitlement to  compensation or damages insofar as such entitlement arises or may arise from your ceasing to  have rights under or to be entitled to the Restricted Stock Units, whether or not as a result of such  termination (whether such termination is in breach of contract or otherwise), or from the loss or  diminution in value of the Restricted Stock Units and/or shares of Common Stock issued under  the Plan. Upon the grant of your Award, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any  such entitlement.  3. Non-Solicitation.   (a) This Paragraph 3 shall apply to you at any time that you hold the title of Vice  President or higher.  (b) You agree that, during your employment and for a period of twelve (12) months  from the date your employment terminates for any reason you will not, without the prior written  consent of the Company or your Employer:   (i) solicit, directly or indirectly, the employment of,   (ii) hire or employ,   </FONT></DIV>
