<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">STATE STREET CORPORATION  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (&#8220;PRSUs&#8221;)  Risk Adjustment Guidelines for EVPs in EMEA  Effective December 20, 2024  Background and Purpose  PRSUs may form a portion of deferred compensation awards made to Executive Vice Presidents  (&#8220;EVPs&#8221;).  PRSUs may also be used to address special circumstances (e.g., awards made to key  personnel upon hire or acquisition).  The purpose of this document is to set out the Risk Adjustment Guidelines (&#8220;the Guidelines&#8221;) that  apply to all PRSU participants who have been designated Identified Staff under one of the relevant  regulatory remuneration regimes1 (&#8220;Participants&#8221;) during the applicable compensation  performance year (or, in special circumstances, at the time of grant) for which the PRSU grant  was made.  The Guidelines will be used to determine a risk adjustment percentage which will then  be factored into the calculation of restricted stock units eligible to vest (payout), if any, under the  applicable PRSU award. This risk adjustment ensures that the calculation of PRSU vested awards  includes a meaningful risk adjustment and is not based solely on financial metrics.  For  Participants, additional regulatory requirements may also be set forth in the applicable PRSU  award agreement.   These Guidelines apply from the date written above and shall remain in effect until changed or  suspended. These Guidelines replace and supersede all prior PRSU Risk Adjustment Guidelines  for EVPs in EMEA.  PRSU Award Grants  Pursuant to the terms of the PRSU award agreement approved by the Human Resources  Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (&#8220;HRC&#8221;), the number of shares that will vest  following the applicable performance period will be determined based on performance metrics set  forth in the PRSU award agreement. This will result in a Total Vesting Percentage within a range  (e.g., 0-150%). The Total Vesting Percentage will then be adjusted based upon the application of  the risk adjustment percentage determined by these Guidelines. The risk adjustment may result  in up to an additional 20% increase or decrease to the Total Vesting Percentage, as determined  under the terms of the relevant PRSU award agreement, at the end of the applicable PRSU  performance period. The resulting vesting percentage of restricted stock units will, however, be  subject to the same applicable range (e.g., a cap of 150% and a floor of 0%). Both the  performance metric results and final total risk adjusted vesting results are certified by the HRC.  The Guidelines   The Enhanced Approach for EMEA Participants  As a starting point for determining the risk adjustment, the Company has existing processes in  EMEA which provide a forum for discussion of risk and compliance considerations applicable to  1 State Street identifies &#8220;staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution&#8217;s risk profile&#8221;  (internally referred to as Identified Staff) in accordance with EBA/RTS/2020/05, the UK Investment Firms Prudential  Regime, Directive (EU) 2019/878 (CRD V), Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFMD) and Directive 2014/91/EU (UCITS V), any  associated remuneration guidelines and any local transpositions in jurisdictions where State Street operates. Identified  Staff are subject to specific remuneration requirements.  Exhibit 10.3D </FONT></DIV>

This existing Identified Staff Red  Flag Review process2 (&#8220;Review&#8221;) has been enhanced, as set forth below, to include a specific  targeted assessment of risk performance for the purposes of determining a risk adjustment  percentage for each Participant.      The EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment Review    The EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment Review process will include:    &#8226; Detailed discussion, or other information made available, on risk and compliance  performance for each Participant. This includes qualitative input from Control Functions  (see Control Functions below) as well as consideration of other available relevant  quantitative metrics, including those contained in EVP scorecards, where applicable.    &#8226; Allocation of appropriate &#8216;ratings&#8217; for each area of consideration with a formulaic outcome  based on the weightings and ratings (see Assessment of Risk Performance below).    In the case of PRSU awards with a performance period that spans multiple years, outputs from  the Reviews during each year of the performance period3 will be consolidated and a formulaic  outcome will be determined for each Participant based on the overall average for each year.    Assessment of Risk Performance     Unless a different methodology is in place for a particular Participant, the areas of consideration  for risk adjustment (including weightings) are set out below:    &#8226; Risk and Compliance Performance (70%)  &#8226; Regulatory Posture (20%)  &#8226; Management Judgment Overlay (10%)    During the EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment Review, detailed discussions will take place for all  Participants and agreement will be reached between the attendees on an appropriate rating for  each area of consideration. The key points of discussion and the ratings themselves will be  recorded in a template that will be completed for each participant for each Review.    A copy of the template to be used during the Reviews is included in the Appendix4. This template  may be updated from time to time to reflect the Company&#8217;s current practices in assessing risk  performance, or a different methodology may be used when determined appropriate by the  reviewers.    Other Considerations      2 For the UK: Head of UK and UK Control Function Heads. For State Street Bank International GmbH (&#8220;SSBI&#8221;): SSBI&#8217;s  CEO and SSBI Control Function Heads. For SSGA Limited (SSGAL) and SSGA Europe Limited (SSGAEL), the Heads  of those entities and their respective Control Function Heads. For State Street Germany Holdings GmbH (SSHG), the  shareholders&#8217; meeting.   3 Meeting intended to align with the Year-End Performance Summary Process in Q4 each year.  4 The template used may vary in form, weightings and metrics considered for those who are not subject to a formal  Red Flag Review process, but will be considered equally valid under these Guidelines.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">      The EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment Review process must also give further consideration to:    &#8226; Cases where it is unclear whether a potential adjustment should be made to a group of  people or to a single individual; and, in the case of the former, the relative responsibility of  members of the group.    &#8226; Significant issues that impact either the incentive compensation pool or an individual  incentive compensation outcome for a given performance year and whether, or the extent  to which, it should additionally impact the PRSU payout for the relevant individual.    Documentation of Review Process     &#8226; The EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment Review process must include detailed and  documented rationale for the determination, including any adjustment. The  determinations, as documented, will support the additional review processes described  under Governance below.    &#8226; GHR Compensation will be responsible for completion of any applicable meeting minutes  and draft risk adjustment templates for Participants. The template should include relevant  information applicable to each area of consideration. Generally, these draft templates  should be circulated seven (7) days prior to the Review to ensure that accurate and  complete information has been captured for all Participants.    Governance5    Control Functions     UK, SSBI, SSGAL and SSGAEL Control Function Heads (&#8220;Control Function Heads&#8221;) will provide  qualitative input for each Participant before or at the time of the EMEA PRSU Risk Adjustment  Review meeting to ensure that it is taken into account in a timely manner.     UK, SSBI, SSGAL and SSGAEL Chief Risk Officers (&#8220;CROs&#8221;)    Annually, the outcome of the overall assessment for each Participant will be provided to the CROs  with potential adjustments highlighted. The CROs will focus on individual risk performance and  input from other Control Function Heads. The CROs may challenge the ratings and request further  discussion on the rationale and level of appropriate adjustment. The CROs may also challenge  cases where adjustments have not been proposed.     UK, SSGAEL and SSBI Remuneration Committees    Annually, the overall assessment for each Participant will be provided to the relevant  Remuneration Committee (&#8220;RemCo&#8221;) for review.  This is to provide the RemCos with an  opportunity to review and challenge the level of proposed adjustments and associated rationales.  The committees may also challenge and/or override cases where:    &#8226; Adjustments have not been proposed; or    5 For Participants of SSHG&#8217;s Board who are also SSBI Supervisory Board members, the equivalent State Street  Corporation Control Functions Heads, including the CRO, are involved instead  </FONT></DIV>
