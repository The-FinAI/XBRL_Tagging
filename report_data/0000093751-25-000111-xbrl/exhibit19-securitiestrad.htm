<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Page 1  February 2025  SECURITIES TRADING POLICY  1. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE; RELATIONSHIP TO STANDARD OF CONDUCT The U.S. federal securities laws prohibit any employee or member of the Board of Directors (a &#8220;Director&#8221;) of State  Street Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) from purchasing or selling Company securities based on material nonpublic  information (&#8220;MNPI&#8221;) concerning the Company, or from disclosing MNPI to others who might trade on the basis of  that information. These laws impose severe sanctions on individuals who violate them. In addition, the Securities  and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) has the authority to impose large fines on the Company and on the Company&#8217;s  Directors and officers if the Company&#8217;s employees engage in insider trading and the Company has failed to take  appropriate steps to prevent it.   In light of these legal requirements, all employees of the Company and its affiliated companies are subject to the  Company&#8217;s Standard of Conduct, which includes provisions relating to &#8220;Personal Trading.&#8221; (For your convenience,  a copy of this section of the Standard of Conduct is included at the end of this Securities Trading Policy (&#8220;Policy&#8221;) as  Attachment A.)  This Policy contains additional requirements relating to trading in the Company&#8217;s securities that apply to  certain employees and all Directors. Therefore, nothing in this Policy limits responsibilities of State Street  employees or Directors under their respective Standards of Conduct. Please also keep in mind that additional  restrictions beyond those contained in the Standard of Conduct or this Policy may apply to employees in certain  business areas. In the event of any inconsistencies among applicable policies, the most restrictive provision will  apply (unless you receive express written notification to the contrary from the General Counsel1).  2. PROHIBITIONS RELATING TO TRANSACTIONS IN THE COMPANY&#8217;S SECURITIES 2.1 This Section 2 applies to: &#8226; all Section 16 officers (and their assistants); &#8226; all executive vice presidents (and their assistants), designated finance, senior business development, M&amp;A, strategy, legal, compliance and investor relations personnel (and their assistants), and such other State Street employees, employees of affiliates, contractors, contingent 1 The General Counsel may appoint designees to perform one or more of their functions under this Policy.
