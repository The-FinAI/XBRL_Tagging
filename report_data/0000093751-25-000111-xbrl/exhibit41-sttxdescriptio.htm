<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Exhibit 4.1          DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER  SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  The following is a description of the general terms and provisions of our securities registered under  Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). This  description is based upon, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our Restated Articles of  Organization, as amended (the &#8220;Restated Articles&#8221;), our By-laws, as amended (the &#8220;By-laws&#8221;),  the certificates of designation with respect to our preferred stock and the deposit agreements with  respect to our depositary shares, all of which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). For purposes of this description, references to &#8220;State Street,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221;  &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ours&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; relate only to State Street Corporation and not its subsidiaries.  General  Our Restated Articles authorize the issuance of up to 750,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00  par value per share, and up to 3,500,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, in one or  more series. Of such number of shares of preferred stock, 5,000 shares have been designated as  Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series G (the &#8220;Series G  Preferred Stock&#8221;), 15,000 shares have been designated as 6.700% Fixed Rate Reset Non- Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series I (the &#8220;Series I Preferred Stock&#8221;), 8,500 shares  have been designated as 6.700% Fixed Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,  Series J (the &#8220;Series J Preferred Stock&#8221;) and 7,500 shares have been designated as 6.450% Fixed  Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series K (the &#8220;Series K Preferred  Stock&#8221;). We redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock in  2009, all of the issued and outstanding shares of our series A preferred stock in 2012, all of the  issued and outstanding shares of our series E preferred stock in 2019, all of the issued and  outstanding shares of our series C preferred stock in 2020, a portion of the issued and outstanding  shares of our series F preferred stock in 2021 and all of the remaining issued and outstanding  shares of our series F preferred stock, as well as all of the issued and outstanding shares of our  series D preferred stock and all of the issued and outstanding shares of our series H preferred stock,  in 2024. All of our outstanding shares of preferred stock are represented by depositary shares.  One of the effects of authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of capital stock may be to  make it more difficult or to discourage an attempt by a potential acquirer to obtain control of our  company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. The issuance of these  shares of capital stock may defer or prevent a change in control of us without any further  shareholder action.  Our common stock and the depositary shares representing our Series G Preferred Stock are  registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. In this description, we refer to the Series G  Preferred Stock as the &#8220;Registered Preferred Stock&#8221; and the Series G Preferred Stock, Series I  Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock collectively as the  &#8220;Outstanding Preferred Stock.&#8221;  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">          2        Description of Common Stock  Dividends and Rights Upon Liquidation  Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by our  board of directors out of any funds legally available for dividends. Holders of our common stock  are also entitled, upon our liquidation, and after claims of creditors and the preferences of any class  or series of preferred stock outstanding at the time of liquidation, to receive pro rata our net assets.  We pay dividends on our common stock only if we have paid or provided for all dividends on our  outstanding classes and series of preferred stock, for the then current period and, in the case of any  cumulative preferred stock, all prior periods.   Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock is subject to certain restrictions as  described in the &#8220;Business&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Capital Planning, Stress Tests and  Dividends&#8221; section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this description has been filed as  an exhibit. We generally are not permitted to purchase shares of our common stock unless full  dividends are paid (or declared, with funds set aside for payment) on all outstanding shares of  preferred stock.  Any outstanding preferred stock has a preference over our common stock with respect to the  payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of our liquidation, winding up or  dissolution, and such other preferences as may be fixed by our board of directors.  Voting Rights  Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share that they hold and are vested  with all of the voting power except as our board of directors has provided, or may provide in the  future, with respect to preferred stock or any other class or series of preferred stock that our board  of directors may hereafter authorize. See &#8220;Description of Preferred Stock&#8221; below.  Other Rights  Shares of our common stock are not redeemable, and have no subscription, conversion or  preemptive rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to shares of our common stock.  Outstanding shares of our common stock are non-assessable. Holders of our common stock are  not, and will not be, subject to any liability as stockholders.  Preferred Stock  Our board of directors can determine the rights, preferences and limitations of each series of our  preferred stock without shareholder action. Therefore, without shareholder approval, our board of  directors can authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights that  could dilute the voting power and other rights of holders of our common stock.

Restrictions on Ownership  The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) requires any &#8220;bank  holding company,&#8221; as defined in the BHC Act, to obtain the approval of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) prior to the acquisition of 5% or more of  our common stock. Any person, other than a bank holding company, is required to obtain prior  approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire 10% or more of our common stock under the Change  in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended. Any holder of 25% or more of our common stock, or  that otherwise exercises a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over us, is subject to regulation as a bank holding  company under the BHC Act. Chapter 167A of the General Laws of Massachusetts requires any  &#8220;bank holding company,&#8221; as defined in Chapter 167A, to obtain prior approval of the board of  bank incorporation before (i) acquiring 5% or more of our common stock, (ii) acquiring all or  substantially all of our assets or (iii) merging or consolidating with us.   Provisions of Our Restated Articles and By-laws and Massachusetts Law That May  Have Anti-Takeover Effects  Certain provisions of our By-laws are designed to make it more difficult for an outsider who does  not have the support of our board of directors to accomplish a takeover. These provisions: (1)  provide that only our board of directors or the Chairman of our board of directors, or one or more  shareholders holding at least 25 percent of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be  considered at a proposed special meeting, have the power to call a special meeting of shareholders;  (2) specify that action by shareholders without a meeting requires the written approval of all  shareholders entitled to vote on the action; and (3) provide that nominations and matters for  shareholder action may only be made by advance written notice. While the foregoing provisions  will not necessarily prevent take-over attempts, they may discourage an attempt to obtain control  of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors by making it more difficult for a third  party to obtain control in a short time and impose its will on our remaining shareholders.  Our Restated Articles provide that none of our directors will be liable to us or our shareholders for  monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty, except to the extent such exculpation from  liability is not permitted under Massachusetts law. This provision does not prevent shareholders  from obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief against directors nor does it shield directors from  liability under federal or state securities laws.   We are covered by the provisions of Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws, the so- called Business Combination Statute. Under Chapter 110F, a Massachusetts corporation with more  than 200 shareholders may not engage in a &#8220;business combination&#8221; with an &#8220;interested  stockholder&#8221; for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person  becomes an interested stockholder, unless (i) the interested stockholder obtains the approval of the  board of directors prior to becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) the interested stockholder  acquires 90% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation (excluding shares held by certain  </FONT></DIV>

An &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or at  any time within the prior three years did own) 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the  corporation. A &#8220;business combination&#8221; includes a merger, a stock or asset sale, and other  transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder.   Our By-laws provide that the provisions of Chapter 110D of the Massachusetts General Laws, the  so-called &#8220;Control Share Statute,&#8221; do not apply to us. However, we may in the future become  subject to the statute if our board of directors votes to amend our By-laws so as to make them  applicable to us. In general, if this statute were applicable it would provide that any person or entity  that acquired 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock could not vote such stock unless our  other shareholders were to so authorize such voting.  Section 8.06(b) of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the &#8220;MBCA&#8221;) provides that  unless a corporation decides otherwise, the terms of directors of a public Massachusetts  corporation shall be staggered by dividing the directors into three groups, as nearly equal in number  as possible, with only one group of directors being elected each year. Sections 8.06(d) and (e) of  the MBCA provide that when directors are so classified, (i) shareholders may remove directors  only for cause, (ii) the number of directors shall be fixed only by the vote of the board of directors,  (iii) vacancies and newly created directorships shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a  majority of the remaining directors, and (iv) a decrease in the number of directors will not shorten  the term of any incumbent director. Our board of directors opted out of this staggered board of  directors requirement, and all of our directors currently serve for one-year terms and are elected  annually. Under Section 8.06(c)(2) of the MBCA, our board of directors may opt into the staggered  board of directors requirements of Section 8.06(b) and the application of Sections 8.06(d) and (e).  If our board of directors opts into this structure, these provisions are likely to increase the time  required for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors. For example, in  general, at least two annual meetings would be necessary for shareholders to effect a change in a  majority of the members of our board of directors. The provision for a classified board could  prevent a party who acquires control of a large portion of our outstanding common stock from  obtaining control of our board of directors until our second annual shareholders meeting following  the date the acquirer obtains the stock interest. The classified board provision could have the effect  of discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain  control of us and could increase the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions.  Description of Preferred Stock  A depositary is the sole holder of each series of Outstanding Preferred Stock, as described under  &#8220;Description of Depositary Shares&#8221; below, and all references in this description to the holders of  a series of the Outstanding Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of  depositary shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the  </FONT></DIV>

Ranking  The Registered Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution  of assets upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the affairs of  State Street:  &#8226; senior to our common stock and any other series of our junior stock that may be issued in  the future;  &#8226; equally with each other series of Outstanding Preferred Stock; and  &#8226; equally with each other series of our preferred stock that by its terms is expressly stated to  be on parity with the Registered Preferred Stock, and junior to any preferred stock that by  its terms is expressly stated to be senior to the Registered Preferred Stock.  In addition, we are generally able to pay dividends and distributions upon the voluntary or  involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of State Street only out of lawfully  available assets for such payment (i.e., after taking account of all indebtedness and other non- equity claims). The Registered Preferred Stock is nonassessable. Holders of the Registered  Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to acquire more capital stock of  State Street.  The Registered Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other  class or series of stock or other securities of State Street. The Registered Preferred Stock has no  stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of State Street to redeem  or repurchase the Registered Preferred Stock.  Each series of Outstanding Preferred Stock ranks equally with the Registered Preferred Stock as  to dividends and distributions on liquidation and includes the same provisions with respect to  restrictions on declaration and payment of dividends and voting rights as apply to the Registered  Preferred Stock.  Holders of Series G Preferred Stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative quarterly dividends  when, as and if declared by our board of directors (or any duly authorized committee of our board  of directors), at a rate of 5.350% per annum. Holders of Series I Preferred Stock are entitled to  receive non-cumulative quarterly dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors (or  any duly authorized committee of our board of directors), (1) at a rate of 6.700% per annum to,  but excluding, March 15, 2029 and (2) thereafter, for each five-year reset period, at a rate per  annum equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury rate as of the most recent reset dividend determination  date, plus 2.613%.

For additional detail on the terms of our existing series of preferred stock, you also should refer to  the respective certificate of designation for each series, each of which is part of our Restated  Articles and on file with the SEC.  Dividends  Dividends on shares of the Registered Preferred Stock are not mandatory and are not cumulative.  Holders of the Registered Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our  board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors out of legally  available assets, non-cumulative cash dividends as follows:  &#8226; Dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock are paid quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of  March, June, September and December. Dividends on the Series G Preferred Stock are  calculated at an annual rate of 5.350% on the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share  of Series G Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share).  If our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors has not  declared a dividend on the Registered Preferred Stock before the dividend payment date for any  dividend period, such dividend shall not be cumulative and shall not be payable for such dividend  period, and we will have no obligation to pay dividends for such dividend period, whether or not  dividends on the Registered Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend period. A  &#8220;dividend period&#8221; with respect to the Registered Preferred Stock means the period from, and  including, a dividend payment date on the Registered Preferred Stock to, but excluding, the next  succeeding dividend payment date.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Registered Preferred Stock shall not be declared,  paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause us to fail to comply with laws and  regulations applicable thereto, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.  With respect to the Registered Preferred Stock, dividends, including dividends payable for any  partial dividend period, are calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Dividends on any Registered Preferred Stock to be redeemed cease to accrue after the redemption  date, as described below under &#8220;&#8212;Redemption,&#8221; unless we default in the payment of the  redemption price of the shares of the Registered Preferred Stock called for redemption.  </FONT></DIV>

Generally, if any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable on the Registered Preferred  Stock is not a business day, then payment of any dividend otherwise payable on such date will be  made on the next succeeding business day, without interest or other payment in respect of such  delay.   &#8220;Business day&#8221; means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor  a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in New  York, New York or Boston, Massachusetts.  Dividends on shares of the Registered Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, if our  board of directors or any duly authorized committee of our board of directors does not declare a  dividend on the Registered Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the  related dividend payment date, such dividend will not be payable and we will have no obligation  to pay, and the holders of the Registered Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive, dividends  for such dividend period on the dividend payment date or at any future time, or interest with respect  to such dividends, whether or not dividends on the Registered Preferred Stock are declared for any  future dividend period.  The terms of the Registered Preferred Stock provide that, so long as any share of the Registered  Preferred Stock remains outstanding,  (1) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall  be declared or made or set aside for payment on any junior stock (other than a dividend  payable solely in junior stock or any dividend or distribution of capital stock or rights to  acquire capital stock of State Street in connection with a shareholders&#8217; rights plan or any  redemption or repurchase of capital stock or rights to acquire capital stock under any such  plan); and  (2) no shares of junior stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for  consideration by us, directly or indirectly (other than (a) as a result of a reclassification of  junior stock for or into other junior stock, (b) the exchange or conversion of one share of  junior stock for or into another share of junior stock, (c) through the use of the proceeds of  a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of junior stock, (d) purchases,  redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of junior stock pursuant to any employment  contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees,  officers, directors or consultants, (e) purchases of shares of junior stock pursuant to a  contractually binding requirement to buy junior stock existing prior to or during the most  recent preceding dividend period for which the full dividends for the then most recently  completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of the Registered Preferred Stock have  </FONT></DIV>

When dividends are not paid in full upon the shares of the Registered Preferred Stock and any  parity stock, all dividends declared upon the shares of the Registered Preferred Stock and any such  parity stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per  share will bear to each other the same ratio as the ratio between the then-current dividends due on  the shares of the Registered Preferred Stock and (i) in the case of any series of parity stock that is  non-cumulative preferred stock, the aggregate of the current and unpaid dividends due on such  series of preferred stock, and (ii) in the case of any series of parity stock that is cumulative preferred  stock, the aggregate of the current and accumulated and unpaid dividends due on such series of  preferred stock.

No interest will be payable in respect of any declared but unpaid dividend payment on shares of  Registered Preferred Stock that is paid after the relevant dividend payment date for such dividend  period.

Liquidation Rights  Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of State  Street, holders of the Registered Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of assets of State Street  legally available for distribution to shareholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors and  subject to the rights of holders of any securities ranking senior to the Registered Preferred Stock,  before any distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or of any of our other shares  of stock ranking junior as to such a distribution to the shares of Registered Preferred Stock, a  liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share  (equivalent to $25 per depositary share) plus declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation  of any undeclared dividends. Holders of the Registered Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any  other amounts from us after they have received their full liquidating distribution.  In any such distribution, if the assets of State Street are not sufficient to pay the liquidation  preferences plus declared and unpaid dividends in full to all holders of the Registered Preferred  Stock and all holders of any other shares of our stock ranking equally as to such distribution with  the Registered Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of the Registered Preferred Stock  and to the holders of all such other parity stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the  respective aggregate liquidating distribution owed to those holders. If the liquidation preference  plus declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of the Registered Preferred  Stock and any other shares of our stock ranking equally as to the liquidation distribution, the  holders of our junior stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of State Street according  to their respective rights and preferences.  For purposes of this section, the merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction  of State Street into or with any other entity, including a merger, consolidation or other business  combination transaction in which the holders of the Registered Preferred Stock receive cash,  securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all  of the property and assets of State Street for cash, securities or other property, shall not constitute  a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of State Street.  The shares of Registered Preferred Stock may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S.  government in the event that we enter into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar  proceeding.

Holders of the Registered Preferred  Stock have no right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Registered Preferred Stock.  Dividends will cease to accrue after the redemption date.

Each notice of redemption will include a statement  setting forth: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Registered Preferred Stock to be  redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of  such shares to be redeemed from such holder (or the method of determining such number); (3) the  redemption price; (4) the place or places where the certificates evidencing shares of the Registered  Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (5) that dividend  rights with respect to the shares to be redeemed will cease on the redemption date.

Section 10.04 of the MBCA entitles the holders of capital stock of a corporation to vote  as a separate class or series under certain circumstances. The certificate of designation creating the  Registered Preferred Stock, which is part of our Restated Articles, expressly provides that Section  11.04(6) of the MBCA (and any similar successor provision of the MBCA) is inapplicable to the  Registered Preferred Stock.  Preemptive and Conversion Rights  The holders of the Registered Preferred Stock do not have any preemptive or conversion rights.  Additional Classes or Series of Stock  We have the right to create and issue additional classes or series of stock ranking equally with or  junior to the Registered Preferred Stock as to dividends and/or distribution of assets upon our  liquidation, dissolution or winding up without the consent of the holders of the Registered  Preferred Stock or the holders of the related depositary shares.

Description of Depositary Shares  In this description, references to &#8220;holders&#8221; of depositary shares mean those who own depositary  shares registered in their own names, on the books that we or the depositary maintain for this  purpose, and not indirect holders who own beneficial interests in depositary shares registered in  street name or issued in book-entry form through DTC.  This description summarizes specific terms and provisions of the depositary shares relating to our  Registered Preferred Stock. As described above under &#8220;Description of Preferred Stock,&#8221; we have  issued fractional interests in shares of preferred stock in the form of depositary shares. Each  depositary share represents a 1/4,000th ownership interest in a share of Registered Preferred Stock  and is evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of Registered Preferred Stock represented by  depositary shares are deposited under a deposit agreement among State Street, Equiniti Trust  Company, LLC (formerly known as American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, LLC), as  depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary  shares. Subject to the terms of the applicable deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share  is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of the  Registered Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences  of the Registered Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and  liquidation rights).  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">         15      Immediately following the issuance of the Registered Preferred Stock, we deposited the shares of  the Registered Preferred Stock with the depositary, which then issued depositary receipts  evidencing the depositary shares to the initial holders thereof. Copies of the deposit agreements  and the forms of depositary receipt are on file with the SEC.  Dividends and Other Distributions  The depositary distributes all cash dividends or other cash distributions, if any, received in respect  of the preferred stock underlying the depositary shares to the record holders of depositary shares  in proportion to the numbers of depositary shares owned by those holders on the relevant record  date. The relevant record date for depositary shares is the same date as the record date for the  preferred stock.  If there is a distribution other than in cash, rights, preferences or privileges the depositary will  distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary shares, unless the depositary  determines, in consultation with us, that it is not feasible to make such distribution. If this occurs,  the depositary may, with our approval, adopt another method for the distribution, including selling  the property (at a public or private sale) in a commercially reasonable manner and distributing the  net proceeds from the sale to the holders.  The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required  to be withheld by the depositary or by us on account of taxes or other governmental charges.  Redemption of Depositary Shares  If we redeem shares of the Registered Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares, the  depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from  the redemption of the Registered Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per  depositary share will be equal to 1/4,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect  to the Registered Preferred Stock (or $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid  dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.  Whenever we redeem shares of the Registered Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the  depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares  representing shares of the Registered Preferred Stock so redeemed. In case of any redemption of  less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be  selected pro rata by lot or in such other manner as our board of directors or any duly authorized  committee of our board may determine to be fair and equitable. The depositary will mail by first  class mail, postage prepaid (or otherwise transmit by an authorized method) notice of redemption  to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the  date fixed for redemption of the Registered Preferred Stock and the related depositary shares.

When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Registered  Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail (or otherwise transmit by an authorized  method) the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares  relating to the Registered Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the depositary shares on the record  date, which is the same date as the record date for the Registered Preferred Stock, may instruct the  depositary to vote the amount of the Registered Preferred Stock represented by the holder&#8217;s  depositary shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Registered  Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives.  We will agree to take all reasonable actions that may be deemed necessary to enable the depositary  to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of  any depositary shares representing the Registered Preferred Stock, it will vote all depositary shares  held by it proportionately with instructions received.  Withdrawal of Stock  Unless the related depositary shares have been previously called for redemption, upon surrender  of the depositary receipts at the office of the depositary, the holder of the depositary shares will be  entitled to delivery, at the office of the depositary to or upon his or her order, of the number of  whole shares of the Registered Preferred Stock and any money or other property represented by  the depositary shares. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of  depositary shares in excess of the number of depositary shares representing the number of whole  shares of Registered Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the depositary will deliver to the holder at  the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of depositary shares. In no  event will the depositary deliver fractional shares of Registered Preferred Stock upon surrender of  depositary receipts. Holders of the Registered Preferred Stock thus withdrawn may not thereafter  deposit those shares under the deposit agreement or receive depositary receipts evidencing  depositary shares therefor.  Charges of Depositary  We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence  of the depositary arrangements. We paid the charges of the depositary in connection with the initial  deposit of the Registered Preferred Stock and will pay the charges of the depositary in connection  any redemption of the Registered Preferred Stock. Holders of depositary receipts will pay transfer,  income and other taxes and governmental charges and such other charges (including those in  connection with the receipt and distribution of dividends, the sale or exercise of rights, the  withdrawal of the Registered Preferred Stock and the transferring, splitting or grouping of  depositary receipts) as are expressly provided in the deposit agreement to be for their accounts.

Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement  The form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit  agreement may be amended by agreement between us and the depositary. However, any  amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders of depositary shares, other  than fee changes, will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of  at least a two-thirds majority of the outstanding depositary shares. The deposit agreement with  respect to the Registered Preferred Stock may be terminated by the depositary or us only:  &#8226; if all outstanding depositary shares have been redeemed;  &#8226; if there has been a final distribution of the Registered Preferred Stock in connection with  our dissolution and such distribution has been made to all the holders of depositary shares;  or  &#8226; upon the consent of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding depositary  shares.  Resignation and Removal of Depositary  The depositary may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so, and we  may remove the depositary at any time. Any resignation or removal of the depositary will take  effect upon our appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment. The  successor depositary must be appointed within 60 days after delivery of the notice of resignation  or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States  and having the requisite combined capital and surplus as set forth in the applicable agreement.
