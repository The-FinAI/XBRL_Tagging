This Policy does not address  disclosure of Cognex information generally, which is covered in the Employee Handbook and non-disclosure agreements,  as applicable.  2.0 DEFINITIONS  2.1  &#8220;Affiliated Persons&#8221; means a person&#8217;s spouse, children, parents, siblings and any other members of their household;  and any investment fund, trust, retirement plan, partnership, corporation or other entity over which such person has  the ability to influence or direct investment decisions concerning securities.   2.2  &#8220;Known Insiders&#8221; means Directors, Officers, non-executive vice presidents and any Cognoid that by the nature of his  or her job responsibilities has access to Material Non-Public Information (including certain financial information)  regarding Cognex on a regular basis, and their respective Affiliated Persons.

If  subject to quiet periods, all Open Orders must be either cancelled or executed prior to entering a Quiet Period. If an  Open Order exists when you obtain Material Non-Public Information, the Open Order must be cancelled immediately  and not executed. If placing an Open Order with a broker, you should inform the broker that you are subject to this  Policy, the pre-clearance procedures and quiet periods, as applicable, to help assure that all Open Orders are cancelled  prior to any quiet periods. Exercise caution when placing Open Orders, such as limit orders, particularly where the  order is likely to remain outstanding for an extended period of time, except in accordance with an Approved 10b5-1  Plan (as discussed below). Open Orders may result in the execution of a trade at a time when you are aware of Material  Non-Public Information or are otherwise not permitted to trade in Cognex securities, which may result in inadvertent  insider trading violations, Section 16 violations (for Reporting Insiders) and violations of this Policy.  2.6  &#8220;Widely Disseminated&#8221; with respect to Material Non-Public Information, means, once the information has been  disclosed broadly to the marketplace, such as after a press release is widely distributed on the Cognex website or by  a news or wire service such as PRNewswire, a Form 8-K or other report is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), or an announcement is made at a conference for which the public had adequate notice and to  which the public was granted access.   3.0 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES OF INSIDERS   Insiders are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:  3.1  Trading, having others trade for the Insider, or recommending that another person trade (&#8220;tipping&#8221;), in (a) Cognex  Corporation securities or (b) the securities of another publicly traded company (such as Cognex customers, vendors  and suppliers) based upon Material Non-Public Information until the information has been Widely Disseminated.  3.2  Disclosing (including by posting on social media, an Internet chat room, message board, or similar Internet-based  forum) Material Non-Public Information about (a) Cognex or (b) another publicly traded company (such as Cognex  customers, vendors and suppliers) obtained through the Insider&#8217;s employment or association with Cognex to anyone  except Cognoids or third-party agents (such as outside legal counsel) whose positions require them to know such  information, until such information has been Widely Disseminated. This includes disclosure to a person&#8217;s family  members, the media, investment analysts or others in the financial community, and other persons, regardless of  whether they learn the information directly from the Insider or indirectly by overhearing the Insider discuss the  information in a public place, such as on an elevator, airplane, or at social or business gatherings.   </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Insider Trading Policy  Version: 3.0                 Page: 3 of 6  3.3 Short selling (the sale of shares of Cognex Corporation stock that the seller does not own but instead borrows to sell)  of Cognex Corporation stock. Such sales are made in anticipation of a decline in the price of Cognex Corporation  stock to enable the seller to cover the sale with a purchase at a later date, at a lower price, and thus at a profit. Any  Cognoid engaged in short sales of Cognex stock is subject to disciplinary action including immediate termination.   3.5 Entering into any hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Cognex Corporation  securities. Hedging means to purchase or sell financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts,  equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engage in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed  to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of Cognex Corporation securities.  3.6 Trading, either directly or indirectly, in exchange-traded options for Cognex Corporation stock or any similar type of  instrument or contract for which the underlying basis is the future price of Cognex Corporation stock (&#8220;Derivatives&#8221;).  An exchange-traded option is the right either to buy or to sell Cognex stock at a fixed price before the option&#8217;s  expiration date. An exchange-traded option that gives right to buy Cognex stock is a call option, and an exchange- traded option that gives a right to sell Cognex stock is a put option. Any Cognoid found to be trading in Derivatives for  Cognex stock is subject to disciplinary action including immediate termination.   4.0 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES OF KNOWN INSIDERS   In addition to the prohibited activities detailed above for Insiders, Known Insiders are prohibited from engaging in the  following activities:   4.1  Pledging any Cognex Corporation securities as collateral for a loan unless the pledge has been approved by the  Compensation Committee of the Cognex Corporation Board of Directors.  4.2 Giving or making any other transfer of Cognex Corporation securities without consideration (e.g., a gift) during a  period when the Known Insider is not permitted to transact in Cognex Corporation securities.  4.3 Selling any Cognex Corporation securities of the same class during the six months following the purchase, or purchasing  any Cognex Corporation securities of the same class during the six months following the sale.  5.0 PRE-CLEARANCE AND REPORTING OF TRANSACTIONS  5.1  All Known Insiders must receive pre-clearance from Cognex&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer or his or her designee (or if our Chief  Legal Officer is the requestor, Cognex&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer or his or her designee) prior to engaging in any  transaction(s) in Cognex Corporation securities (even when Cognex is not in a quiet period). A request for preclearance  to engage in transactions involving Cognex Corporation securities should be submitted to our Chief Legal Officer via  email no more than two business days in advance of the proposed transaction or Open Order. Clearance of a  transaction does not constitute a recommendation by Cognex or any Cognoid that you engage in the proposed  transaction. When a request for preclearance is made, the Known Insider should summarize the details of the  proposed transaction and confirm in the request that he or she (i) has reviewed this Policy; and (ii) is not aware of any  Material Non-Public Information. If our Chief Legal Officer grants preclearance, the Known Insider may make the trade  or enter into an Open Order at any time within, but not after, two trading days of receipt of preclearance. If the Known  Insider becomes aware of Material Non-Public Information before the transaction is completed (whether through an  Open Order or otherwise), the preclearance shall be void and the transaction must not be completed. If permission  to engage in the transaction is denied, the Known Insider must refrain from initiating any transaction in Cognex  Corporation securities and may not inform any other person of the denial.  5.2 Directors and those Cognoids designated by the Cognex Board of Directors as &#8220;executive officers&#8221; for SEC reporting  purposes (&#8220;Reporting Insiders&#8221;) are obligated to file certain reports with the SEC when they engage in transactions  involving Cognex Corporation securities.

The Reporting  Insider retains responsibility for these reports regardless of who assists in their preparation and filing.   6.0  QUIET PERIODS; RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS  6.1 From time-to-time, the Chief Legal Officer or his designee, at his or her discretion, may notify Insiders that they are  subject to a Cognex-designated &#8220;quiet period.&#8221;  Such Insiders and all Known Insiders are prohibited from transacting  in Cognex Corporation securities during quiet periods, including under Open Orders (other than under an Approved  Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan). The current quiet period schedule is detailed in Appendix B.   6.2 The prohibition set forth in Section 6.1 does not apply to the exercise of stock options with no associated sale of the  underlying stock. It does apply, however, to the use of outstanding Cognex Corporation securities to constitute part  or all of the exercise price of a stock option, any same day sale of an option, or any other market sale. For purposes of  this Section 6.2, &#8220;same day sale&#8221; of a stock option means the exercise of a stock option simultaneously with the sale  of the underlying Cognex Corporation stock. As a result, the person does not use his or her cash to exercise a stock  option, and instead receives the net proceeds from the transaction.   6.3 Cognex Corporation securities may be purchased or sold by Known Insiders without complying with the procedures  set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 under a pre-existing written plan, contract or instruction that satisfies the  requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (an &#8220;Approved Rule 10b5-1  Plan&#8221;) that:  &#8226; has been pre-approved by Cognex&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer or his or her designee, before adopted (and, if  modified, such modifications have been reviewed and approved by our Chief Legal Officer or his or her  designee);   &#8226; was adopted (and amended, if applicable) outside of a quiet period;  &#8226; provides that no trades may occur thereunder until expiration of the applicable cooling-off period  specified in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(B), and no trades occur until after such cooling-off period;  &#8226; was entered into in good faith by the Known Insider, and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the  prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1, at a time when the Known Insider is not in possession of Material Non- Public Information; and, if the Known Insider is a Director or Officer, includes representations certifying  to that effect;  &#8226; gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute purchases and sales, outside of the Known  Insider&#8217;s control, so long as such third party does not possess any Material Non-Public Information; or  explicitly specifies the securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares, the prices and/or dates  of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions;  &#8226; allows for only one Rule 10b5-1 Plan designed to effect the open-market purchase or sale of the total  amount of securities as a single transaction (a single-trade plan) to be maintained by the Known Insider  with a 12-month period; and  &#8226; is the only outstanding Rule 10b5-1 Plan entered into by the Known Insider (subject to the exceptions  set out in Rule 10b5-1(c)(ii)(D)).    6.4 The Known Insider should instruct the third party effecting such transactions on its behalf under an Approved 10b5- 1 Plan to send duplicate confirmations of all transactions to Cognex&#8217;s Equity Manager.  7.0 INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY   Insiders are responsible for complying with this Policy and all applicable securities laws.

In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an  Insider is in possession of Material Non-Public Information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of Cognex  or any Cognoid pursuant to this Policy does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an individual from liability  under applicable securities laws. Insiders may have to delay a proposed transaction in Cognex Corporation securities even  if they planned to make the transaction before learning of Material Non-Public Information and even though they believe  they may suffer an economic loss or miss a profit by waiting.  8.0 COMPLIANCE; REPORTING VIOLATIONS  8.1 Any Cognoid, regardless of position or title, who violates any provision of this Policy may be subject to disciplinary  action, up to and including termination of employment.  8.2 A person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company&#8217;s securities when he or she has  Material Non-Public Information can be sentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a criminal penalty of  several times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided. In addition, a person who recommends that another person  trade based on Material Non-Public Information may also be liable for transactions by the person to whom he or she  has disclosed Material Non-Public Information. The SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who,  at the time of an insider trading violation, &#8220;directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed such violation.&#8221;  8.3 If any Director or Cognoid violates this Policy or any federal or state laws governing insider trading, or know of any  such violation by any Insider, such person must report the violation immediately to the Chief Legal Officer or his or  her designee (508-650-3000), or by submitting a complaint via Cognex&#8217;s third-party &#8220;Integrity Hotline,&#8221; which provides  both phone-based and online anonymous reporting options (www.cognex.com/hotline). Such person may also raise  the matter with the Chairman of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors by U.S. mail to Audit Committee  Chairman, Cognex Corporation, One Vision Drive, Natick, MA 01760.  9.0 ADMINISTRATION  9.1 Cognex reserves the right to change, modify, or delete the provisions of this Policy without notice.   9.2 The Legal Department is responsible for the administration of this Policy. All Cognoids are responsible for consulting  and complying with the most current version of this Policy. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact  the Legal Department.
