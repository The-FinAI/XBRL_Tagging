In other words, it is to help prevent insider trading. In addition to setting forth  general restrictions applicable to all directors, officers and employees, this Policy also sets  forth additional procedures for certain personnel and board members who routinely have  access to Material Nonpublic Information, to help these individuals trade securities of the  Company appropriately and in compliance with applicable law.      All directors, officers and employees of the Company (as well as their family  members and any other entity over which they make or influence investment  decisions, as described below) are expected to fully comply with this Insider  Trading Policy.     What is Insider Trading    The Company and its &#8220;insiders,&#8221; including any director, officer or employee of the Company  or any Company subsidiary (including, for example, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation,  Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Kentucky Utilities Company, Rhode Island Energy and  PPL Services Corporation), are each subject to the securities laws of the United States and  all applicable jurisdictions.  Those laws prohibit insiders from buying or selling, or otherwise  Exhibit 19  </FONT></DIV>

Such conduct is often described as &#8220;insider trading&#8221;.   Insider trading also includes insiders passing Material Nonpublic Information to someone  else, including family members, who may buy or sell the Company&#8217;s Securities.  Such  conduct is known as &#8220;tipping&#8221;.  Finally, insider trading also includes buying or selling, or  otherwise acquiring or disposing of the securities of, or tipping information concerning, any  other company at a time that you have any Material Nonpublic Information about that  company as a result of your employment with the Company.    For purposes of this Policy, &#8220;Securities&#8221; include common and preferred stock, stock  options, warrants, bonds, notes, debentures, convertible instruments, put or call options  (i.e., exchange-traded options) or other similar financial instruments. &#8220;Material Nonpublic  Information&#8221; is information that is both material and nonpublic.  Material information is  generally information that might affect a person&#8217;s decision to buy or sell a security or,  stated another way, information that if public, could reasonably be expected to affect the  publicly traded price of that company&#8217;s stock.  Material information might include:    &#8226; dividend increases or decreases,  &#8226; earnings results and estimates (including changes of previously announced estimates),  &#8226; planned repurchases or issuances of equity or debt,  &#8226; a change or curtailment of operations of significant facilities,  &#8226; a significant increase or decline in business or revenue,  &#8226; a significant merger or acquisition proposal or agreement,  &#8226; actions by regulatory bodies,  &#8226; significant management changes,  &#8226; the initiation of or a significant development in major litigation,   &#8226; purchases or sales of substantial assets, or   &#8226; a major cybersecurity breach.     The foregoing list is not exhaustive; the determination of materiality is highly fact-sensitive  and must be viewed in the context of the relevant circumstances.  Nonpublic information  is information that is not available to the general public. Information is considered nonpublic  until the information has been (a) widely disseminated, (b) through an official  announcement (the announcement generally has come from the Company), and (c) a  reasonable amount of time, usually at least 24 hours, a portion of which the New York Stock  Exchange is open, has passed to allow the market to react to the information.  You should  assume information is nonpublic unless it has been distributed on a national news service or  expressly included in a Company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).      Who is at risk    The securities laws provide that liability regarding insider trading, including potentially civil  and criminal penalties, can apply to the individual insider and to the Company and its  directors and officers, and can even extend to managerial and supervisory personnel. It is  the intent of this Policy to avoid both individual insider liability and broader enterprise  liability for insider trading.      General Policy Applicable to all Insiders    As an insider, you may not do any of the following:    </FONT></DIV>

If you have any questions about whether you are in possession  of Material Nonpublic Information, please contact the Office of General Counsel.    o Trade Securities of any other company (including Securities issued by any of our  customers or suppliers) at any time when you have Material Nonpublic Information  about that company that you obtained as a result of your employment with or  relationship to the Company.    o &#8220;Tip&#8221; anyone (including family members), even inadvertently (take care not to have  such information overheard).  &#8220;Tipping&#8221; is disclosing any Material Nonpublic Information  to anyone that does not have a business need to know such information.  If you disclose  Material Nonpublic Information to a third party or become aware that such information  has been disclosed to a third party by an insider in violation of this Policy, immediately  contact the Office of General Counsel.     o Make buy or sell recommendations about the Company&#8217;s securities.    When you leave the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, as a precaution you  should generally not trade in the Securities of the Company until the opening of the first  open trading window (as described below) following the termination of your employment, or  as otherwise indicated at the time of your departure.  Section 16 Persons and Permanent  Restricted Persons, as defined below, should plan to wait six months after leaving the  company before trading any Company Securities.     Limited Exceptions to Trading Prohibitions Under the General Policy    The restrictions above generally do not apply in the following circumstances:    &#61623; You transfer shares to an inter vivos trust or similar entity that does not change the  beneficial ownership of the shares;  &#61623; You transfer shares as a bona fide gift, including in connection with charitable giving,  though you should contact OGC to discuss the circumstances and timing prior to  making such transfers;  &#61623; You exercise an option to acquire stock granted under the Company&#8217;s incentive  compensation plans without any sale, (however, sales of the underlying stock after  exercise, or in connection with any cashless exercise, would be covered by this  Policy);   &#61623; You elect to have the Company withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding  requirements (such as net share settlement of stock options) without effecting any  sale;   &#61623; You execute transactions pursuant to a trading plan that complies with SEC Rule  10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (commonly known as &#8220;10b5-1  Plans&#8221;) and which has been approved by the Company; or    &#61623; You purchase stock through regular payroll deductions under the Company&#8217;s  Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan; provided, however, the sale  of any such stock, and any change in instructions regarding the level of contributions  used to purchase stock, is subject to this policy.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    4      These exceptions are fact specific.  You should contact the Office of General Counsel to  discuss your particular circumstances whenever you are in doubt about any trade of  Securities or before attempting to rely on any of the above exceptions.    Special Procedures &#8211; Section 16 Persons, Permanent and  Other Restricted Persons    Enhanced trading restrictions and procedures apply to (i) Section 16 Persons, which  include members of the PPL Corporation Board of Directors and certain officers of the  Company as defined by SEC Rule 16a-1(f) (together with any such persons&#8217; immediate  family members, and any trusts, corporations or other entities controlled by any such  persons), (ii) Permanent Restricted Persons, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 executives   who are not Section 16 Persons and certain others as determined by the Office of General  Counsel, and (iii) Other Restricted Persons, which includes those who have been notified  by the Office of General Counsel that they must follow the requirements this Policy because  they have access to Nonpublic Information in the normal course of their duties.  Prior to  buying or selling, or otherwise acquiring or disposing of any shares of PPL stock, Section 16  Persons, Permanent Restricted Persons and Other Restricted Persons must contact the  Office of General Counsel.  Additional restrictions, set for the below, are generally based on  &#8220;trading windows.&#8221;     Trading Windows      &#8220;Open trading windows&#8221; generally occur four times a year, typically running from the day  after quarterly/annual earnings announcements to the fifteenth day of the third month in  each fiscal quarter (March, June, September, and December).  A &#8220;closed trading window&#8221;  occurs when the Company is aware that many insiders who are subject to enhanced trading  restrictions are likely aware of Material Nonpublic Information, generally in connection with  the preparation of quarterly financial reports.  Closed trading windows typically run from the  fifteenth of the month in the third month of a fiscal quarter until the day following the  announcement of earnings for that quarter, when the next open trading window begins.  In  certain circumstances, trading windows may not open as normal, or may close earlier than  expected, based on Material Nonpublic Information that is generally known inside the  Company.  Even during an open trading window, certain insiders may be prohibited from  trading PPL stock, because they may be aware of specific Material Nonpublic Information.   For example, when a significant transaction is being contemplated, some but not all insiders  may be aware of the details of the proposed transaction, and therefore restricted from  trading, even in an open trading window.     The Office of General Counsel will announce via email the opening and closing of trading  windows to all insiders who are subject to enhanced trading restrictions, and in certain  circumstances, may notify specific insiders that they should not trade, even if the trading  window is open for others.  Insiders should not share with anyone whether they are  restricted from trading.  Trading windows are designed to add an additional layer of  protection with respect to insider trading, both for the Company and the individual insider,  but all insiders remain subject to the general policy discussed above.  Even if the trading  window is open, you may not trade, or establish, modify or terminate a 10b5-1  Plan, as discussed below, without prior approval from the Office of General  Counsel or if you are aware of Material Nonpublic Information.    </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    5    Actions permitted and restricted during open and closed trading windows, and other  applicable restrictions on certain insiders, are discussed further below.      General Restrictions &#8211; Section 16 Persons, Permanent and Other Restricted  Persons    All Section 16 Persons and Permanent Restricted Persons must hold all of the Company&#8217;s  Securities that they own in a brokerage account at Fidelity Investments (or any successor  as the stock plan administrator).  Such accounts are subject to restriction by the Office of  General Counsel.  Section 16 Persons and Permanently Restricted Persons must conduct all  trading in Company Securities using 10b5-1 Plans that permit Insiders to schedule future  trades of Company Securities, as described below.  10b5-1 Plans must be reviewed and  approved by the Office of General Counsel before execution.      Section 16 Persons, Permanently Restricted Persons and Other Restricted Persons may not  (i) trade in options, warrants, puts and calls or similar instruments related to the Company&#8217;s  Securities or sell such Securities &#8220;short&#8221; (i.e., sell stock they do not own and borrow the  shares to make delivery), because this may put their personal gain in conflict with the best  interests of the Company or otherwise appear improper, or (ii) pledge the Company&#8217;s  Securities as collateral for any other securities you wish to purchase or for a loan.    Other Restricted Persons who wish to trade during an open trading window may contact the  Office of General Counsel, and they will be asked to confirm that they are not in possession  of any Material Nonpublic Information.  If they are not in possession of Material Nonpublic  Information, the Office of General Counsel generally will permit the trade and, if the shares  are held in a Fidelity account, the trade restriction on the account will be lifted for 24-48  hours, or longer as needed, to allow the Section 16 Persons, Permanently Restricted  Persons or Other Restricted Persons to complete the trade.  Other Restricted Persons are  permitted but not required to use 10b5-1 Plans.    Exceptions for Approved 10b5-1 Plans    10b5-1 Plans may be entered into only during open trading windows when the insider is not  in possession of Material Nonpublic Information.  A 10b5-1 Plan is a binding, written  contract between you and your broker (i.e., Fidelity Investments, or any successor as the  Company&#8217;s stock plan administrator) that specifies the price, amount and date of trades to  be executed in your account in the future, or provides a formula or mechanism that your  broker will follow to execute a desired transaction.  While a 10b5-1 Plan can only be  established, modified or terminated during an open trading window when you do not  possess Material Nonpublic Information, trades made pursuant to a properly established  10b5-1 Plan may be executed at any time, even during a closed trading window.    As part of the 10b5-1 Plan document, you must provide a written representation that, at the  time of entering into (or modifying) the 10b5-1 Plan, you are not then in possession of any  material nonpublic information and that you are acting in good faith and not as part of a  plan to evade the prohibitions of SEC Rule 10b5-1.  Once the 10b5-1 Plan is adopted, you  must not exercise any influence over execution of transactions under the plan, such as the  number or value of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the  date of the trade.  Any such modification would be considered entering into a new plan and  would be subject to the restrictions of entering into a new plan.        </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">    6    10b5-1 Plans may cover a period up to two years and trades under a 10b5-1 Plan may  commence no sooner than 30 days after execution for Permanent Restricted Persons and  any other person electing to use a 10b5-1 Plan, except Section 16 Persons.  For Section 16  Persons, trades pursuant to a 10b5-1 Plan may commence after the longer of (i) 90 days  after the adoption or modification of a plan, or (ii) two business days following the filing of  10-Q or 10-K for the fiscal period in which the plan was adopted or modified, up to a  maximum of 120 days.      10b5-1 Plans, and any modifications, are drafted with the assistance of Fidelity  Investments, and are reviewed by the Office of General Counsel prior to execution.  10b5-1  Plans must comply with all other applicable legal requirements and SEC Rule 10b5-1,  including without limitation, the SEC Rule 10b5-1 limitations on multiple overlapping plans  and single-trade plans.  If you have any questions regarding 10b5-1 Plans, please contact  the Office of General Counsel.  Notwithstanding any pre-clearance of a 10b5-1 Plan, the  Company assumes no liability for the consequences of any transaction made pursuant to a  purported 10b5-1 Plan.    The requirement to trade via a 10b5-1 Plan does not apply to (i) the receipt and disposition  of credits received by members of the PPL Corporation Board of Directors pursuant to the  Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, which credits are reportable under Section 16 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for which separate procedures are administered by the  Office of General Counsel and (ii) the purchase of PPL stock by employees through regular  payroll deductions under the Company&#8217;s Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase  Plan; provided, however, the sale of any such stock, and any change in instructions  regarding the level of contributions used to purchase stock, must be made in an open  trading window when the insider is not in possession of Material Nonpublic Information.    Confidentiality    You must not disclose any Material Nonpublic Information to anyone outside of the  Company (including to family members), except when such disclosure is needed to carry out  the Company&#8217;s business and then only when you have no reason to believe that the  recipient will misuse the information.  When such information is disclosed, the recipient  must be told that such information may be used only for the business purpose related to its  disclosure and that the information must be held in confidence.  You should disclose Material  Nonpublic Information to others in the Company only in the ordinary course of business, for  legitimate business purposes.      You may not respond to questions or comment publicly to anyone outside the Company on  stock price movements or rumors about other material corporate developments (including  discussions in Internet &#8220;chat rooms&#8221; or through &#8220;social media&#8221;) unless it is part of your job  (such as Investor Relations) or you have been specifically authorized to do so by the Chief  Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer in each instance (see Standards of Integrity,  CP100 and Social Media Policy, CP411 for additional information).  If you receive requests  for information from the financial community, such as securities analysts, brokers or  institutional investors, they should be directed to the Vice President-Investor Relations.   Requests for information from the SEC or other regulators should be directed to the Office  of General Counsel.  Requests for information from individual shareowners should be  directed to the Company&#8217;s transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, at 1-800-345-3085 or  via email to invserv@pplweb.com.  If you inadvertently comment on stock price movements  or rumors of other material corporate developments, you must immediately contact the  Office of General Counsel.  </FONT></DIV>

Each individual is responsible for making sure that they (and their family  members or other entities over which they make or influence investment decisions) comply  with this Policy.  This means that each individual is responsible for the transactions of their  family members and should make their family members aware of the need to confer with  them before they trade in Company Securities, and each individual should treat all such  transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the  transactions were for their own account.  In all cases, you are responsible for determining whether you are in possession of Material  Nonpublic Information, and any action on the part of the Company, the Office of the General  Counsel or any other employee or director pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in  any way constitute legal advice or insulate you from liability under applicable securities  laws.

Failure to follow this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to  and including termination of employment, regardless of whether the employee&#8217;s failure to  comply results in a violation of law.  A violation of this Policy also constitutes a violation of  PPL&#8217;s Standards of Integrity (CP100) and will be handled in accordance with the Responsible  Behavior Program (GP702) or your employer&#8217;s equivalent discipline policy.
