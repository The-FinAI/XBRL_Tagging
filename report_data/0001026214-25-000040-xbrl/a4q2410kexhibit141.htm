To best fulfill our Mission, we must  conduct business ethically and in compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the law, our policies, and our Values.  We recognize that good ethics is good for business.   Our Code of Conduct sets critical expectations for the actions we take and competencies we demonstrate.  It outlines the responsibilities that we have to each other, our business partners, our competitors, and our customers.  What is right, fair, or compliant isn&#8217;t always obvious, especially in the face of conflicting priorities or business  pressures. The Code also provides us with ethical decision-making guidelines to help in those &#8220;gray areas&#8221;. Does the Code apply to me?   The Code applies to all full- and part-time employees, including senior management and executives.  We also expect that those who work with Freddie Mac, including contingent workers, independent contractors, and  consultants, will embrace the spirit of the Code and adhere to its standards.  Any waiver of the Code for executive officers must be approved by the Board or a Board committee and  promptly disclosed to the public on our website. This prevents waivers of the Code from being hidden from the public  and complies with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) requirements and similar rules under the Securities and Exchange  Commission and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Using the Code Read the Code and take time to understand our Company&#8217;s expectations and how they apply to your role at Freddie  Mac. Come back to the Code in situations where you&#8217;re not sure of the right answer &#8212; especially if there are likely legal  or ethical risks to you or to the business. What if I can&#8217;t find an answer in the Code?  While the Code strives to be comprehensive, it can&#8217;t anticipate every situation that you may encounter. For additional  information, review the relevant policies or consult the Compliance &amp; Ethics Helpline for guidance. INTRODUCTION </FONT></DIV>

Company policies, and their associated standards, are available on HomeFront. Our policies and standards support the  Code by presenting additional details and cover other topics not found in the Code. Relevant policies and standards are  indexed at the end of the Code, to make it easy to find a specific resource when you need more detailed information.  Each employee is responsible for understanding and following all of Freddie Mac&#8217;s policies and standards. What happens if someone violates the standards in our Code or the law? Complying with the Code of Conduct and applicable laws is a condition of employment. Failure to comply will result  in corrective action, up to and including termination. Who can I talk to if I have questions or concerns? When facing a challenging situation, there are resources to help guide you. You can contact the Ethics Office or the  Compliance &amp; Ethics Helpline, Human Resources, the Legal Division, or a manager in your division. Our Managers and Executives Play a Key Role We are all responsible for our culture, but those who manage people &#8212; all people managers, including senior  management and executives &#8212; have a special responsibility to lead the way. We expect all people managers to:  &#8226; Act as role models &#8226; Champion a culture of integrity and compliance &#8226; Promote high ethical standards &#8226; Recognize and reward behavior that exemplifies our Values and our Code &#8226; Make sure employees are appropriately trained and competent &#8226; Assist in enforcing the Code &#8226; Report any violations or potential violations of the Code in a timely manner  Additionally, senior management is responsible for making sure the company has the resources to effectively  execute our mission.  Certain members of leadership, including the CEO, President, CFO and Principal Accounting Officer/Controller, must  also promote full, fair, accurate and understandable disclosures in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) and in other public communications regarding our financial condition. Their ethical actions in this area set the tone  for how our company, and every individual who works on its behalf, are perceived by the outside world. 2 The Freddie Mac Code of Conduct   |   I N T R O D U C T I O N </FONT></DIV>

To do this, we must be able to accurately evaluate situations and make good choices. If you&#8217;re facing a situation where the right choice is not clear, take a moment to assess your  options in terms of our Values. And if you see something that may violate the Code, report it.  We are mission driven Am I making a decision that is in the best interest of Freddie Mac and its stakeholders and  appropriately managing the related risks?  We do the right thing Am I acting with integrity and accountability? We perform with excellence Am I meeting my obligations by exhibiting Freddie Mac&#8217;s expected behavioral competencies? We are inclusive Am I creating space for those with different perspectives to be engaged? For additional insight, consider the ethical issues at stake. Ask: Right versus wrong: Am I being asked to do something that might be inappropriate? Are  there legal or ethical concerns? Potential consequences: Could someone or something be harmed by my decision? Reputational effect: Would others understand my decision? Could I explain it to my manager, a  friend or someone I admired? Could the decision reflect poorly on me or Freddie Mac? Due diligence: Have I verified important facts and assumptions? If I&#8217;m not sure after trying to  verify, have I asked others who may know?  Throughout the Code you will find scenarios where we demonstrate how to apply our Values  and use these additional questions.

Remember, you are  representing Freddie Mac. Bringing Our Values Home   &#8220;I was in a meeting led by the senior leader of my division to develop our succession plan, a  plan at least two-deep for manager-level positions and above. This initiative is in response  to several sudden departures, and I agreed to be on the task force. Unfortunately, this comes  during our busiest time of the year. Some on the task force are anxious to get it done. They are  advocating to simply name the two employees next in line to each position. This tactic would  result in very little diversity among leadership. I don&#8217;t want to hold everyone up, but I think a  more inclusive approach is necessary.&#8221; Consider Our Values We are Inclusive: Diversity in leadership, and at all levels, is crucial to our organization&#8217;s  success, from performance and culture to employee recruitment and retention.   Consider the Ethical Issues at Stake Potential Consequences: We have a duty to report to the Federal Housing Finance Agency  (FHFA) on our DEI efforts in hiring and workplace practices. Fast tracking the succession  planning process and overlooking the requirement to identify qualified diverse candidates  can undermine our efforts to promote DEI and is counter to our stated goals.  Due Diligence: Our policies contain guidance to help us make sure existing internal diverse talent  is given opportunities while meeting our hiring standards and succession planning needs.

I made some subtle comments to her after  I witnessed a particularly tense exchange between her and a member of her team, but she  brushed me off.

We finished work on a key document  right at the end of the day. Trying to make our deadline, my co-worker sent the document to  his personal Gmail account to print from home and do his review from there. I didn&#8217;t think  anything about it at the time, but later that night I remembered the document was marked  &#8220;Confidential&#8221;. I also remembered it was against policy to email such documents to a personal  account. The next day my co-worker and I let our manager know what happened, and she  informed Information Security right away.&#8221; Consider Our Values We do the right thing: We all have a responsibility to speak up when we see a possible  violation, or behavior that is concerning.    Consider the Ethical Issues at Stake Potential Consequences:  Sending and storing Freddie Mac Restricted, Confidential,   or Non-Public information to a non-Freddie Mac computer leaves it vulnerable to a data  breach. Additionally, ignoring such behavior from others weakens our ethical culture and  hurts Freddie Mac.   Reputational Effect: When we don&#8217;t appropriately handle information, we risk losing the  confidence of our stakeholders to be a trusted partner.

Personal Investments and Insider Trading &#8226; If you have material, non-public information (MNPI) about a company, do not purchase or sell securities in   that company, and do not &#8220;tip&#8221; anyone else to trade. &#8226; We prohibit employees and their Related Individuals from engaging in certain transactions, including   purchasing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities. &#8226; If you already own Freddie Mac securities, only sell them after obtaining pre-clearance, and during an   approved window period. &#8226; Obtain pre-clearance for certain other transactions, including private placements.  &#8226; Follow all Information Wall restrictions to prevent the flow of MNPI (including material non-public FHFA information)  to your colleagues identified as Restricted Persons. We put the  company&#8217;s interests  before our own and  disclose conflicts   of interest. S E C T I O N  3 </FONT></DIV>

We depend on  everyone working collaboratively to complete our projects.  Many of us started noticing that  our project manager rescheduled meetings at the last minute, was never on camera, and he  didn&#8217;t engage in the discussion. Rumors started that he was working another full-time job or  &#8220;daylighting&#8221; on Freddie Mac&#8217;s time. The project manager&#8217;s behavior affected our team&#8217;s  morale, and, eventually, we missed a key deadline for a big project. I shared my concerns with  our boss who hadn&#8217;t realized the extent of the problem.&#8221; Consider Our Values We perform with excellence: While employees are generally allowed to engage in   outside activities, including second jobs, we must prioritize our Freddie Mac job duties  and responsibilities.     Consider the Ethical Issues at Stake Right Versus Wrong: We owe it to our teammates to be accountable for our time and work  output. If you notice a team member is not meeting their responsibilities, speaking-up to your  manager is the right course of action. Due Diligence: Before engaging in any outside activity, check the policy so you know how to  avoid a conflict and when you are required to disclose to management and Ethics. &#8220;During a conversation over lunch with a co-worker, he showed me a new investment app his  spouse is now using.  He explained the app is like other stock trading apps where you self- manage your investment portfolio, but this app is focused solely on real estate investments.  I asked if he had received approval to use the app, and he replied approval wasn&#8217;t needed  since his spouse owns the account not him. I shared that before my kid opened a stock trading  account as part of a college course, I reached out to Ethics for guidance. I suggested he do the  same before his spouse goes much further with the app.&#8221; Consider Our Values We are mission driven: Employees are responsible for pre-clearing personal investment activities,  including those of Related Individuals such as your spouse, to avoid potential conflicts of interest.  This allows us to support our mission without the appearance of impropriety. Consider the Ethical Issues at Stake Right Versus Wrong: At Freddie Mac we speak up and inform our colleagues of potential  actions that may violate our policies and Code of Conduct.   Due Diligence: We are all expected to understand the Code of Conduct and its underlying  policies. The expectations around the personal investment policy can be complex.
