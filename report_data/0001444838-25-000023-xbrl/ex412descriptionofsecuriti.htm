In uncontested elections of trustees at a meeting duly called at which a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote is sufficient to elect a trustee nominee. In contested elections at a meeting duly called at which a quorum is present, a plurality of votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote is required for the election of a trustee. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted &#8220;for&#8221; a trustee nominee must exceed the number of votes cast &#8220;against&#8221; or &#8220;withheld&#8221; with respect to such trustee nominee. Votes &#8220;against&#8221; or &#8220;withheld&#8221; with respect to a nominee will count as votes cast with respect to that nominee, but &#8220;abstentions&#8221; and broker non-votes with respect to that nominee will not count as votes cast with respect to that nominee. There is no cumulative voting in the election of trustees, which means that the holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares can elect all of the trustees then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining common shares will not be able to elect any trustees.</font></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Subject to the provisions of our Declaration of Trust regarding excess shares, holders of common shares have no conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights or preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="height:72pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div><font><br></font></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:72pt;width:100%"><div><font><br></font></div></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">We furnish our shareholders with annual reports containing audited consolidated financial statements and an opinion thereon expressed by an independent registered public accounting firm.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">Subject to the provisions of our Declaration of Trust regarding excess shares, all of the common shares have equal dividend, distribution, liquidation and other rights and generally have no preference, appraisal or exchange rights.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">Restrictions on Ownership</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:100%">For us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, among other things, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year.
