We have no current plans to issue any shares of Class C common stock. However, we may in the future issue shares of Class C common stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including financings, acquisitions, investments, and equity incentives to our employees, consultants, and directors, and the Class C common stock provides us with the flexibility to do so without diluting the existing voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law) and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock may be able to hold significant voting control and determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. In addition, if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class&#160;B common stock.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Preferred Stock</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our board of directors is authorized to direct us to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval, unless required by law or by any stock exchange, and subject to the rights granted to Advance pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Governance Agreement.
