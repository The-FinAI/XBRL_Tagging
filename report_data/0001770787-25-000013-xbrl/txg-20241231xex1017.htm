Employee will be given notice of any demand for arbitration by 10x at the last home address contained in 10x&#8217;s records (or to Employee&#8217;s counsel, if applicable). The Arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the propriety of the demand for arbitration and apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the claim(s) had been brought in court.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">The Parties mutually agree that after a party initiates the claim by making a written demand for arbitration there will be a thirty-day &#8220;Cooling Off Period.&#8221; During the Cooling Off Period, the Parties may attempt to resolve the claim. The Parties may also mutually agree to extend the Cooling Off Period. During the Cooling Off Period, either party may request an informal meeting to discuss a potential informal resolution of the dispute, without the need to go forward in an arbitration (&#8220;Informal Settlement Conference&#8221;). If timely requested, the Informal Settlement Conference will take place at a mutually agreeable time by telephone or videoconference. Employee and a 10x representative must both personally participate&#59; any counsel representing Employee or 10x also may participate. The requirement of personal participation in an Informal Settlement Conference may be waived only if both Employee and an authorized representative of 10x agree in writing. The Cooling Off Period and Informal Settlement Conference are to allow the Parties to attempt resolution. At the end of the Cooling Off Period or if an Informal Settlement Conference is timely requested, thirty days after completion of the Informal Settlement Conference, and unless the Parties have resolved the claim, the Parties will begin the Arbitrator selection process as described above in Section 3. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, an Arbitrator and&#47;or any arbitration sponsoring organization is without authority to accept or administer any arbitration demand, or assess or demand fees for the arbitration, unless and until the Parties have complied with the demand for arbitration process and the Cooling Off Period, as well as the Informal Settlement Conference, if requested by either party.  In addition, if arbitration is commenced without submitting a complete demand for arbitration, during the Cooling Off Period, or without participating in a timely requested Informal Settlement Conference, the Parties agree that a court shall have the authority to enjoin the arbitration or the assessment of any arbitrator or arbitration administrator fees in connection with such an arbitration.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:112%">7.</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:112%;padding-left:27.67pt;text-decoration:underline">DISCOVERY AND SUBPOENAS</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div style="text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">Each party may take the deposition of three individual fact witnesses and any expert witness designated by another party.
